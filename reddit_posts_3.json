Plus, the texture is smooth, so it shouldn't feel overly dense or heavy.\u00a0  \n\n\nBtw, different nuts have different protein amounts, where walnuts have about 4 and peanuts have as much as 7 grams per ounce. A protein calculator could make it easier to track your needs and how different foods contribute to them.",

Lean meat, eggs, dairy (greek yogurt, cottage cheese), legumes, tofu and tempeh (if you like soy).\n\nTrail mixes are also a nice touch. Almonds, cashews, chia seed, peanuts, dried edamame and lentils are excellent protein-packed options you can add to the mix. They include 5-6 g/oz of protein each.   \n  \nIn short, I just try to add more protein to my diet by prioritizing protein-rich foods and snacks I enjoy (this will make sticking to your plan easier).\u00a0\n\nAlso, aim for a consistent protein intake rather than relying on large amounts at one time. And since you don\u2019t mind taking whey there are whey protein isolates that are less dense than concentrates you can try. I haven\u2019t tried any but I know people who swear by them.",

Here are some practical tips to help you get the most out of your pre workout nutrition:\n\n1. **Lunch Timing**: Try to have a substantial lunch 3-4 hours before your workout. This should give your body enough time to process, digest and convert the food into energy.\n2. **Balanced Meals**: Make sure your lunch includes a good mix of protein, carbs, and healthy fats, like grilled chicken with quinoa and vegetables which provide sustained energy.\n3. **Pre Workout Snack**: Since your workout is in the late afternoon, try having a smaller snack about 30-60 minutes before you exercise. A good option might be Greek yogurt with some fruit or 30-60 grams of nuts and a piece of fruit. Try not to eat very heavy or greasy foods as they might weigh you down.\n4. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink water throughout the day. Sometimes that feeling of tiredness or fatigue can be due to dehydration.\n5. **Experiment**: Try different snack sizes and timings to see what works best, try adjusting it a bit every time so you can keep record of it and make accurate conclusions. You might find that having your snack 90 minutes before your workout works better for you, instead of 60 minutes for example.\n6. **Listen to Your Body**: Everyone is different, so it might take several tries, after some trial and error to figure out what works best for you, you will be on the right track.\n\nHopefully, modifying these aspects of your nutrition will help improve your performance on those later workout days.",

Since your working out at home you won\u2019t have that issue getting others sick. \n\nSince covid can cause alot of Respiratory Issues and muscle aches it can interfere with working out as the body needs oxygen. \n\nThe primary reason why it\u2019s bad to workout when sick is recovery. When you break down muscle tissue and you want it to rebuild and recover you are using your body\u2019s resources think of your computer with a like 20 tabs open vs 3 tabs there\u2019s a lot of energy and resources and management that\u2019s is being used on all those tabs being open.\n\nSame with your body if your body is fighting a cold or flu or symptoms it needs those resources to fight the invaders and recover. Your body has already dedicated those resources to recovering from being sick. It will have a hard time trying to do both recovery from sickness and recovery from working out. \n\nWorking out while sick can hinder your recovery thus putting you at risk for getting sicker because of your weakened immune system so what can happen is not recovering properly to rebuild muscle tissue so it\u2019s a lose lose situation \n\nYou know your body better than anyone and what it\u2019s capable of. You can do a mild workout to test the waters. \n\nA light 45 minute workout with less sets more rest time. Or cut the volume in half and do less and see how you feel from there. Then you can increase the sets and intensity accordingly. Just make sure to sleep. Stay hydrated and eat enough for recovery",

So, your metabolism goes down and that means it becomes even easier for your body to gain weight faster than before because it\u2019s easier to be on a caloric surplus when your metabolism is low.\u00a0\n\nThe solution? You guessed it! It\u2019s pretty much doing some form of resistance training to build some muscle because muscle needs more energy to maintain, which means you\u2019ll need more calories to maintain them. Exercise generally raises your metabolism, and building some muscle means your metabolism increases and you can easily keep off the weight after losing fat.",

I have been drinking more alcohol (partly because of band-practice, which sucks of crouse) and have had less time for the gym in general. But if i lost any muscle mass, you would notice definitely.\n\n\nHow could that be? I mean I'm still active, mountainbiking, and basically walking everywhere by foot, but that doesn't make my biceps grow? lol.\n\nI do eat healthy tho.

Then I did nothing for a year and as a result I'm now what I'd say is skinny fat (180cm-75kg/5'11''-165lb with high BF %). My core has always been weak, even at my best.\n\nI whipped up a quick plan for starting off just running and strengthening my core with some quick research and with the help of ChatGPT:\n\nDay 1 Morning : \n\n* Plank: 3 sets of 30-45 seconds\n\n* Russian Twists: 3 sets of 15-20 reps per side\n\n* Dead Bug: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per side\n\nDay 1 Night: \n\n* Run: 20-30 minutes at a comfortable pace. \n\nDay 2 Morning:\n\n* Side Plank: 3 sets of 20-30 seconds per side\n\n* Bird-Dog: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per side\n\n* Glute Bridge: 3 sets of 15-20 reps\n\nDay 2 Night:\n\n* Run: 5-minute warm-up jog, then 1 minute of fast running followed by 2 minutes of walking or light jogging. Repeat for 20 minutes.\n\nDay 3 Rest\n\nDay 4 Morning:\n\n* Bicycle Crunches: 3 sets of 15-20 reps per side\n\n* Mountain Climbers: 3 sets of 20-30 seconds\n\n* Leg Raises: 3 sets of 10-15 reps\n\nDay 4 Night:\n\n* Run: 30-40 minutes at a moderate pace, slightly faster than Day 1 but still comfortable.\n\nDay 5 Morning: \n\n* Hollow Body Hold: 3 sets of 20-30 seconds\n\n* Superman: 3 sets of 15-20 reps\n\n* Reverse Crunches: 3 sets of 12-15 reps\n\nDay 5 Night:\n\n* Run: Hill Run for 20-25 minutes. \n\nDay 6 Morning:\n\n* Plank: 3 sets of 45-60 seconds\n\n* Flutter Kicks: 3 sets of 20-30 seconds\n\n* Side Plank with Hip Dips: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per side\n\nDay 6 Night:\n\n* Run: 40-50 minutes at an easy, conversational pace. Focus on endurance.\n\nDay 7 Rest.\n\nI'd like to finally say I have a strong core before starting other programs and bulking up, doing functional training, etc.\nIs it a good idea to run this for 1-2 months, all the while eating for maintenance? Or should I be in caloric surplus or deficit? Do you have improvements to my plan?\n\nAll opinions welcome",

Average the weights before and after the week, and you know how much you gained or lost over the week. Add all the calories up and subtract 3500 for each lb you gained or add 3500 for each lb you lost. Then divide by 7. That\u2019s your daily maintenance calories. This method adjusts for the mislabeling of the typical food you eat, and your individual propensity to cheat without realizing it. You\u2019ll find you\u2019re eating way more than you thought. \n\nOnce you have maintenance, you drop 250 calories and day and that equals 2 lbs per month of weight loss.",

I pushed myself to far because I wanted more muscle all the time and it even worked out at that time aswell. But at 20 years of age, my elbow,knee and shoulder joints are all fucked. It got so bad I had to stop for several years and I lost almost all my gains. Now  I can only do calisthenics and even there I have to be super catious. Probably will never be able to go weighted. If I see people who can, I still get madly jealous. Dont progress the weights to fast, joints and tendons take almost four times longer to adapt than muscles and they heal badly if injured. \n\nI\u2018m not saying dont go all out, train everyday if you feel like it but be caucious with your body, if some exercise hurt, stop it and work on the weak link. For example if your front shoulder hurts while doing bench press, stop training chest until you feel no more pain. Then go back to training chest but lower the volume for chest and work more on your front shoulder. If you feel like you progressed decently in your front shoulder, go back to your old bench press workout. \n\nSorry for the long story but I always wished someone would have told me at 16 and not to find out by myself when its to late.

My main meals have been a local burrito place (get a bowl with double white rice, black beans, chicken, pickled onions, sour cream, cheddar cheese, & pico), and a homemade bowl with jasmine rice and chicken. I work at a coffee place and make an asiago bagel with egg, bacon, cheese, onions, avocado and cream cheese for my lunch break. I average 3000 calories a day. I workout almost daily with a push/pull/legs split. I am 5'11 and recently went from 160lbs to 174lbs, but I've noticed I'm gaining a lot more of a gut than I ever thought I would. I'm considering calling off the bulk because while I am noticing minimal gain in chest, shoulders, biceps, legs, etc., I'm gaining a large gut and have never had to deal with something like this and feel very uncomfortable.

                "comment": "3000 seems like too much. The more you are above maintenance calories, the more fat you will gain. The literature and experts suggests that beginners should gain 1-1.5% weight per month MAX in order to gain with a good muscle ratios. At 160, that would mean 2.4 lbs per month, so it should have taken you roughly 6 months to gain that much weight. If you gained it faster than that its kind of expected that you would put on a lot of fat with your muscle.\n\nMy honest advice, and its probably not what you want to hear, but at this point I would switch to a cut and get back down to a body fat level you are comfortable with. Use the militaries waist formula to estimate your body fat now, and lose max 1 lb per week on a cut until you really like the way you look and retest body fat levels every month. Then switch back to a bulk and do it WAY slower while monitoring body fat percentage. If you determine that you were gaining 2.4 lbs per month, I would go for more like 1.5 lbs per month next time. You should basically always be getting higher in body fat percentage during a bulk (cutting is for losing body fat percentage), but not to the extent that you did. Generally, I don't think cutting is a great tool for non event based dieting (ie unless you are doing it for a contest or photoshoot or vacation). This is because its hard to keep off fat if you are going below your normal bodyfat percentage, and it hides the fact that your habits haven't permanently changed. However, since you just bulked and this is above your normal body fat percentage, I'd try to get back down to something closer to your norm, because staying above your norm body fat percentage for a long time resets your norm to the higher number (reverse is not the case).",

The bike itself should give you another 300 calories per day depending on how long you do it, which with diet should total to about 5,000 extra calories expended per week, which is almost 2lb of fat (7000 cal, each pound is about 3500 cal).\n\nAnd if you\u2019re drinking any calories, like alcohol, soda, juices, coffee with creamer, then try eliminating those too. It\u2019s super easy to drink calories.\n\nIf you need help trying to figure out diet, I\u2019d look at apps, such as MyFitnessPal to identify how many calories you\u2019re eating on average per day.

The 5% that doesn't gain it back does so by being EXTREME for the rest of their lives. For example, my friend went from obese to 6 pack, and kept it for 10 years, but he worked out 250 times per year and ate chicken broccoli 6x per week, and weighed himself EVERY day. He didn't miss days for anything.  \n  \nInstead of dieting, you should make lifestyle changes that are sustainable. Those changes should be centered around the following:  \n-No processed foods or artificial sugar (eating these foods make you eat more than you need even weeks later)  \n-Get enough protein, about 1g per lb of muscle that you have (this is because protein lets you retain muscle and build muscle when otherwise it would be stored as fat... its also satiating)  \n-Lift weights but start really, really slow given your age (this is like protein in that it stores your extra calories as muscle instead of fat). Also note, that you won't be able to get \"big\" like a guy no matter how much you lift.  \n-Increase your activity in all possible ways by committing to lifestyle changes (same as above, plus it gives you energy to do the lifts and it improves hormone health which means lower bodyfat)\n\nThe other option is the medical route of a obesity medication (eg Ozempic). These drugs really actually work, but they are lifelong, and if you don't lift weights and eat LOTS of protein, you will lose weight in an extremely unhealthy way (ie you will lose way too much muscle). Total muscle is a super strong predictor of longevity, so you don't want to lose too much if you go this route.",

Its slow but people (including myself) have attempted very low calorie crash diets to drop weight quicker and it always ends up with breaking the diet and gaining all the weight back.\n\nHigh protein and low carbs work for me. Chicken and beef are dense and take time to digest so you feel full longer than if you ate a slice or two of pizza which is around the same calories.",

                "comment": "I'm **not** learned in the subject at all, I haven't gone to classes, read books etc, so I can understand ignoring my post. \nBut I *have* been in your situation, and there are some things I wish I knew before I entered into the journey of losing weight.\n\nFirst of all, your best friend in the entire world is water, I can not hype water enough, it's a miracle drug, if you're hungry, you can drink a litre of water and feel filled. \nAlso I started thinking of sleep as a speed hack, if you're hungry late at night? drink a litre of water, and go to bed. There you go, now it's breakfast, food.\nSomething to note is that the body can only efficiently filter 0.8-1L of water an hour, so I'd recommend staying within that limit, but don't get worried, you can drink a lot of water.\n\n\nThe most important thing to learn however when losing weight is calories.\nPeople love to spout information about this and that, carbs, trans fats, blabla, while that is all true, it doesn't matter that much to someone trying to lose extreme weight, it's good information for when you're at a normal weight sure, but when losing weight? just count calories, that should be your bible, think of your weight as a mathematical problem. \n1 kg= 7700 calories, let's say your body burn 2000 calories a day, technically you can lose ~2kg a week if you simply don't eat anything.\nI wouldn't recommend doing that of course, but that's thinking with calories, you could technically eat a bag of chips a day if you want, as long as it has less calories than what your body burns in a day, it's just straight up math.\nThere are sites to calculate your daily calorie consumption online.\n\nAnother thing I wish I knew before the journey was that it never hurts consuming daily vitamins/minerals pills, no matter which way you decide to lose weight, it's very hard to get everything the body needs everyday, so this is just a good way to make sure nothing goes wrong with the body's needs, and if you gain excess of anything, you'll just end up peeing it out.\n\nAlso, people tend to simply tell you to exercise, you don't have to do that, exercise burns calories, yes, but as long as you stay within your limit of calories you don't have to supplement your calorie deficiency with exercising, sure it speeds it along, no doubt about that, and I personally like cycling during the weekend, but it's not a required thing for losing weight.\n\nI'd suggest getting a calorie deficiency of roughly 1000, that way you lose a kg a week, if not more depending on how many calories your body burns everyday, 2000 sounds like a fairly plausible one for you, but again, check online for a calculator to calculate it correctly.\n\nAt the end of the day, if there is one thing you take away from this post, I want it to be this:\nIf you burn 2000 calories everyday, as long as you consume less than that everyday, you WILL lose weight, it DOESN'T really matter where those calories come from, carbs? fat? it doesn't matter, as long as it's less calories than\u00c2\u00a0your burn everyday.\nWhat works for you depends on the type of person you are.\n\nI personally were 400lbs ~180 kg since my teens, at 33 I started doing the following:\nI stopped eating, I ate 1 meal every third day, for about 3 months I kept this up, and water of course.\nAfter 3 months of doing that I was down to 290 lbs ~140kg(its fast as hell in the start)\nHowever I started getting sick regularly, so I figured maybe eating more regularly was a better idea, so I ate a chicken breast, and a cucumber everyday.\n\n\n2 months later, I'm still getting sick, and I'm now starting to lose my hair, but I was down to 230 LBS ~115kg\nAt this point I started to realize that i'm really just hurting myself, I started looking up some information online, I started to eat 3 meals a day, which added up to ~1000 calories in total, breakfast Protein Oatmeal, lunch Protein oatmeal, dinner a stew with a lot of meat, vegetables etc, things the body need, and a multi vitamin/mineral pill for the things that I simply don't gain normally.\n\n\nFast Forward 3 months, I'm 190 lbs ~95kg. I'm not sick anymore, and I'm regaining my hair. \nSure, the weight loss was slower now, but I didn't much mind anymore, my original goal was 100kg anyway.\n\n5 months later, which is now, I'm at 85kg, and I still have the same routine, oatmeal for breakfast and lunch, and my stew for dinner with a pill. I don't really lose weight anymore, I tend to hover at around 84 as my lowest now. I'm in general a really big guy, my side of the family is, and I'm 187cm tall, at this point I probably have around 3-5 kg in loose skin as well, so I understand why i'm not really losing anymore weight, I think i'm at a fairly normally weight,\nLately I've started experimenting, keeping my diet routine the same, and having something like two  pizza with an insane amount of sauce and fries on the weekend (saturday & sunday) and I seem to lose the extra transient weight during the week, so i'm fairly comfortable with that kind of lifestyle, eat the diet I do, but eat literally whatever I want during the weekend, and not really gaining any weight, that is what works for me.\n\n\nThe reason I went into this detail is to clarify that what works for me, or Person A, or person B, wouldn't necessarily work for you, its a very personal thing I feel like, Hopefully something of what I said clicks for you, but I honestly believe it wont matter unless you've really hit the moment when you basically say \"Fuck it, I'm just going to do it\" \nFor me the trigger, funnily enough, was family and friends around me stopping to encourage me to lose weight, it meant that they finally gave up trying to\u00c2\u00a0convince me to lose weight, they didn't believe I could do it anymore, and who can blame them? 33 years of being overweight, I get it, but it made me incredibly motivated to almost sort of spite them by doing what they didn't think I could anymore.\nI guess i'm a fairly spiteful person lol.\n\nTLDR: Eat less calories than what your body burns, depending on how much less your consume, the faster it is, doesn't matter what kind of calories you consume, be it pizza, or salads.\n\n\nBad formatting, hade to post this on my Phone.",

So you may need to fill it out with some more muscle and it may look less indented or it could actually fill out we won\u2019t know until you build some mass on it.\n\nThat said the Chest muscle is One large muscle a lot of people think it\u2019s 3 different muscle parts with the upper, middle and lower. The muscle fibres run down, across and above. So if you want to specialize in hitting the chest you can direct more focus to the upper muscle fibres, middle or lower.\n\nI think you should focus on building the Overall Chest Muscle with a focus on lower chest development so you can fill out that lower indent portion. After you have built some mass it may just fill out and look normal. Or it will fill out and you\u2019ll have a little indent that may not be noticeable cuz you\u2019ll have more mass on your chest.\n\nThe flaws show more on the body when there is less muscle and/or a lagging body part.\n\nIt\u2019s better to have a full chest development with a little indent than a flat chest with a noticeable indent so focus on building the chest and you can see if it\u2019s genetic or if it just needed to be more developed\n\nAnd yeah being strong with chest doesn\u2019t mean shieet it\u2019s all about the muscle development",

I feel I look quite small with little muscle but still have a lot of belly fat. \n\nI started with recomping, eating at a deficit and lifting and it worked for some time as strength was improving and I was losing weight. I was increasing my calories as well and was still maintaining/losing weight at 2500 cal. \n\nThen I tried bulking eating at 3000 calories and my weight started going up. Strength did go up slightly for a little bit but quickly stopped getting stronger and even losing strength some times? \n\nI take the inbody test once a week to see if I made any progress by comparing to previous tests as I know they are inaccurate. The stuff I eat is usually the same on days I take the test. For 2 months my skeletal muscle mass consistently went down and my body fat went up. There was never an increase in skeletal muscle mass. At this point I have lost 2kg of skeletal muscle mass and gained 1kg of fat according to it. \n\nI eat minimum of 150g of protein a day upwards of 200g and I sleep at least 8 hours a day for most days. For training I do a 2 day split twice a week, back, legs, biceps then shoulders, chest, triceps. Usually 6 sets per muscle per session targetting 12 reps. \n\nThe only thing I can think of is my training is shit but I'm very focused on ensuring my form is correct and pushing as hard as possible. Usually I get comments that my form is really good and that I push really hard from other people at the gym. I'm pretty bad at estimating remaining reps so I tend to go to muscular failure. My brain thinks I can do more but my body will not lift the weights. I do slow concentric movements as well. \n\nOne of my friends that I made in the gym is a sciency guy and kept telling me I'm doing too much so I have started to try make sure I'm close to failure but not hit it for the past month. My strength I feel is quite low compared to everyone else even beginners. Strength has stagnanted the past few months and am very inconsistent with the number of reps I can do each session.\n\nI'm trying my best but not only am I not progressing I am actively getting worse. I feel I look fatter and small but I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong and it is seriously affecting me. Do I need to eat even more? I'm already gaining fat even though I have a belly and there is no strength or muscle gains. \n\nTl;dr: 150g protein minimum each day, tried 3000 calories and 2500 calories but both show decrease in skeletal muscle and increase in body fat. Look the same or worse as 5 months ago. Strength stagnate or sometimes worse. Usually train to failure 4 times a week",

I don't know what inbody machine you are using, but as you know the scales aren't particularly accurate for body fat percentage (and all the sub-categories are almost completely useless). However, if you are putting on weight, but your lifts aren't going up then you are probably gaining fat... so its not the measurement.\n\nSecond, you should concentrate on just maintaining weight until you can figure out why your lifts aren't improving. Maybe you need to switch up your workout to periodize it. You should look into how to break through plateaus on youtube. Until your lifts are going up, you aren't making new muscle, so having a calorie surplus is a negative.\n\nYou might also look at your hormone health (testosterone for example). A prolonged cut (which you did) can reduce T levels for a while. T levels don't seem to make much of a difference at the high end of normal in terms of muscle gain, but they do make a difference at the low end (and of course at 2-3x supernatural steroid levels).\n\nGenerally speaking it sounds from your description like you are doing things mostly right... it might be you don't realize you are doing something wrong, or it might be that your genetics don't fit your workout, or it might be that your workout is good, but you need some advanced techniques like periodization or drop sets. If its genetic, then you need to increase or decrease the volume/intensity until you find what fits your genetics. Remember that even one single extra rep is progressive overload. Oh, also, I'd look into recovery if you are feeling really spent all the time.",

I was hoping I\u2019d be were I want at 160 but thinking I might need to hit more like 155-150. I\u2019m also wondering if I should still bulk at 160 because with more muscle mass it will make the next cut easier and more defined, or if I should focus on get much leaner first so I don\u2019t fatten up to much. All thoughts and estimates are greatly appreciated.",

If I continue the cut it will be nine weeks in total and I should be around 164 lbs. My question is, is it alright that I am cutting down past my original starting weight? 5'10\".

It\u2019s been about a year since then I eat whatever I want and rarely go to the gym, I\u2019m now 70kg (been averaging 15k steps a day and eating about 2000+ calories atleast) I want to get back into the gym but still having energy problems I\u2019m motivated and I go but I just can\u2019t workout, I end up exhausted mid way through my set and can\u2019t push anymore even though I don\u2019t feel any burn in the muscles. It\u2019s hard for me to explain but imagine doing 10 reps on bench press and you start to struggle at 7 and really have to work to push out those last 3, for me I get to 4 and instead of struggling at 5 the weights just don\u2019t go up no matter how hard I push and even with assistance from a friend.\n\nSleep, more water, creatine and trying different times at the gym to see when my body reacts better are what I\u2019m going to try and do, is there anything else I need to focus on?",

                "comment": "I've been going through this a bit, as I'm getting back into the gym at near 40 after some injuries. I've found two things that have helped: First, I started slow... I was doing 60-75 hard minutes in the gym 4x per week. The issue was that when I came back, I would lose motivation at like 20 minutes. The solution for me has been to design a workout that is only 30 minutes (more achievable) and then just do it everyday. So I always go, and I do like 2 sets of 5 exercises and leave. I plan on slowly building up my ability to \"push through,\" at which point I'll add exercises as I get more used to the additional work. You need to design your gym goals to be things that you can accomplish, so that you feel good about the work you are doing.\n\nAdditionally, getting my testosterone up through lifestyle and some supplementation has helped as well. In retrospect, I think there is some evidence that low T effects ability to push through tough things. However, I would say that I'm not a doctor and I didn't expect improving my t to help me push through my workouts. I looked at T because high T results in VERY slightly lower bodyfat percentage, but it seemed to help my mental gym performance.\n\nI don't really know what you mean about getting tired through a couple reps. Maybe you need to lower the weight, or track it more closely so that you are really trying to beat your old record of reps by a tiny bit (\"I did 4 last time, I'm going to get 5 this time\").\n\nAs far as your overall tiredness and weight loss... Weight loss causes tiredness. Your body is programmed to get you back to old fat levels, and part of the way it does it is to make you tired so you move less. You might need to add some good fats into your diet for hormone levels. You might need to see if you can add like 100 calories a day without putting on weight - there isn't one number of maintenance calories, its a range of several hundred calories and if you are at the bottom of it, you will be more tired and less active, then if you are at the top of your maintenance range. Mostly I think you need to start slow but deliberately",

        "content": "Hi all. I\u2019m relatively new (this time round) to resistance training, I used to work out a fair bit in my teens and early 20s but having let myself go for a decade or two I\u2019m now getting a bit serious about things again in my late 30s. \n\nI\u2019ve been loosely following this dumbbell only guide from Buff Dudes for the last ten weeks, modifying it to suit my own goals, weaknesses and abilities. Up until now, each muscle group has been worked 2-3 times a week, but now it\u2019s moving into its final phase each muscle group has its own dedicated day.\n\nI\u2019m aware is fairly common practice, and of the rationale behind doing it this way \u2013 it allows you to really focus in on the muscles worked, hit them hard and with variation, push them to failure and then get a good recovery in afterwards \u2013 but I\u2019d always been under the impression that it\u2019s best to hit each muscle group at least twice a week.*\n\nSo my question is, is hitting each muscle group only one day a week really beneficial/optimal? And if not, and assuming I only have chance to train once a day, how does one strike a balance between training a muscle group thoroughly as well as more regularly.\n\nPlease forgive my ignorance, I still kind of have no idea what I\u2019m doing, but I\u2019m autistic and get quite frustrated when things aren\u2019t as obvious and straightforward as I\u2019d like them to be.\n\n*(For example, I used to do a simple upper/lower split hitting everything twice per week. A whole week\u2019s rest for a muscle group seems unnecessary, and sub-optimal for progress. This is received wisdom and to be honest I\u2019ve no idea where I received it from, but it makes sense to me.)",
