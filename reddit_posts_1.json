I\u2019ve managed to actually build a decent amount of muscle during this process but had some significant muscular burnout. I was lifting 6 days a week until about 8 weeks ago when I hurt my shoulder. \n\nAfter going to a PT and doing consistent cardio during that time, I\u2019m returning to the gym Tuesday to lift. With that in mind, I\u2019m curious if I\u2019m eating enough or too few calories. \n\nWith My Fitness Pal, I\u2019ve been eating about 1,900 calories at 155g of protein a day. I thought I\u2019d give MacroFactor a try and it\u2019s suggesting I eat 2,660 calories a day with 181g of protein. \n\n**Am I going to gain weight eating 2,660cals with more protein, or will that lean me out further and help me maintain and build muscle?**\n\nFor reference, I\u2019ve been at 1,900 cals since about April.",

I have been on this program for 6 weeks so far and I am really enjoying doing a bro split instead of PPL but besides that my question is about rest days.\n\nI want to improve my cardio so I started setting a goal for myself of walking 10 miles a day. 3 miles is at the gym on a treadmill at a 6% incline at 3.0 speed with my average heart rate being at 120-130 and the rest is done at home, outside. Is there any chance that this can disrupt my rest days?\n\nEventually I plan to start jogging/running to increase my cardiovascular health in the morning so it wont disrupt my workout in the afternoon but could that also disrupt my rest day as well?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Please tell me I made the perfect program!\" Nobody of the more seasoned guys around here is willing to debate this anymore since it is always the same discussion where you have to fill every bit of knowledge gap within someone who thinks he is an expert after 15 youtube videos and 2 training sessions.\n\n>I didn't just make the program from whim.\n\nFrom what else? You are a newbie with very limited knowledge and no experience. That leaves whim and guesswork.\n\n>I looked at 100s of programs available online\n\nAnd you understand none of them on more than a surface level because you lack any experience of running them or similar stuff and have no real idea of why they are set up like they are.\n\n>Your acting as though the people that make programs add something in the program that no normal guy can dream of?\n\nIt is not about adding some magic sauce, but laying out the structure of the program and manipulating the variables over time in a way that ensures progress without burning yourself out.\n\nYou on the other hand just play around with stuff like \"and adjusted the volume to fit me\" for the sake of doing your own stuff.

I'll do my best to be helpful and answer some of your questions. \n\n- I never said there are no 6 day programs. Someone else said it a bit jokingly, implying that there ARE a lot of 6 day programs and that you didn't need to adjust things to make stuff into a 6 day program.\n\n- I think the difference in experience and theory really matters here. You don't have to believe me, but I can promise you that it is. I also wanna stress that thinking about what you're doing and listening to experts is awesome and great. And that many beginners make great progress making their own stuff with educated reasoning behind their choices.\n\n- BUT you're asking why you haven't made the progress that  you were hoping for. I'm suggesting that not following a tested program might be part of the problem. You don't have to follow my advice, or believe it is a problem. All I'm saying is that it might be a good idea to consider it.\n\n- Lastly, PPLxPPL is not a program, it's a split. A program has a method of progression, weight and exercise selection and will prescribe a wide variety of rep ranges. How that program is split up into different days is only part of its entirety.",

I've been following my program for about 10 weeks now and will continue for about 2 or 3 more weeks then switch it up with something else online. I guess the main takeaway is that I am indeed getting stronger so there is progress but I was just highlighting my frustration about any visual changes, which I guess will come very very slowly.

If you want a good program check out the recommended routines in the fitness wiki.\n\nSome personal recommendations: I think I've said it before, but I really enjoyed gzclp when I started out. It's a bit more powerlifty than what you might like, but doing heavy barbell stuff gives you a really solid base to build on. It also leaves a lot of room to start adding exercises that you want to do and really think about why you want to add it in. I think you might enjoy that kind of freedom. I know I did, and it really prepared me to not just be a routine following robot but really understand why things are programmed the way they are. After gzclp I did JnT 2.0, which was awesome and maybe more up your alley (sidenote, you DONT wanna do JnT in a deficit, definitely eat in a surplus for that). After that I bought the SBS program bundle for 10 bucks, ran a bunch of stuff there and can also highly recommend it, I think they have a beginner program as well.",

You could train for 5 years sub-optimally for growth but obviously still gain muscle then on the 6th year after you finally figure out the optimal way to train for yourself such as the perfect personal grips/exercise selection/general rep ranges/when to switch rep ranges/maximum recoverable volume/when to go to failure or leave a rep or 2 in the tank etc you could have more progress in that 1 year than you did from year 2 to year 1. \n\nAlso you could develop many muscle groups over the span of 5 years and let\u2019s say you barely trained calves or biceps that whole time and on the 6th year you decide to hammer them specifically, they will experience \u201cnoob gains\u201d.\n\nAlso if you decide to bulk to 80kg over a year or 2 you\u2019d probably have a similar amount of body fat % as year 1 but you\u2019d be generally bigger because of an extra 5+kg of muscle",

A slight angle change, a change in the time under tension, an experiment with different rep schemes and volume. If I have went years without really doing face pulls, my face pulls will go up quickly ish when I start. If I did legs but never did RDL'S much and start, I'll make some quick gains there. I wouldn't say any of that is as impactful as newbie gains though. When I first started lifting I gained 20 (good) pounds in just a couple months. That will never happen for me again. But what I just described is how you progress in other ways after you've lifted for a long time. Change rep schemes, if you always did a certain thing for hamstrings, work in a new one for a while. If you bent over row and lat pull a lot, but never do seated cable rows, start working those in. stuff like that. It definitely also helps to get wiser though. I'd do things differently if I started over from scratch, compared to how I was doing things a few years in. And on the plus side, the wiser you get with it, the more efficient you can be to at least maintain where you're at. 90 min can be turned into 45 min of an effective lifting session doing just as well for you",

My first year was very bad split/training wise, but I was still making progress. Once I had a very drastic shift to low volume, heavy weights, and increased stability for MUR, I saw as good or better progress than my first year.",

So yes, it\u2019s true you shouldn\u2019t sacrifice good form for the sake of heavier weights, but you should still push yourself to the very limit of what you CAN do with good form.

Also, pick a weight that you can only do for 8-12 reps, and you start to break form on the 11th or 12th rep.\n\nIf this is 12.5, then 17.5 would be great I think.

The issue is generally when you try and actually  lift and maintain that position, which you don't. \n\nThat said, it doesn't let you get as tight as if you were to pull the slack out before the lift. If you have a look on this page https://www.strongerbyscience.com/how-to-deadlift/ and search for technique and go down to the second block the word is featured in it lists 5 different starting techniques. \n\nThe rolling isn't necessary and is more likely to lead to an inconsistent starting position.\n\nEdit: on second look it does look like you try and provide resistance when the hips are low. But if that is a way you find it easier to catch the starting height it isn't wrong, just *let* them rise rather than having them rise as a consequence of trying to start too low..",

That lead to inconsistency and imbalance.    \n   \nSo eventually I made my own routine. I started with the 6 basic movement types: horizontal and vertical upper push, vertical and horizontal upper pull, quad dominant, and hamstring dominant. I built a schedule that fit my needs. Then I paid attention to what was missing/lagging behind: arms (especially biceps), abs, side and rear delts, traps, and forearms. I made adjustments. Now I hit everything consistently and with sufficient volume without aggravating my old injuries and on a schedule that works for me.",

Also, I\u2019m bending and lifting things just about every day so it\u2019s been the most useful exercise I never even considered doing when I was younger. \n\nI\u2019d say squats too, but I messed up my knee doing something else (side effect of aging, your connective tissue gives out easy) and haven\u2019t been able to do them in a while.\n\nOnce you get comfortable using the smith machine, and unless you\u2019re injured or compromised somehow, I highly recommend using a regular barbell - you\u2019ll have to lift relatively light at first, but it\u2019s a far better workout than a smith machine (which keeps you in a fixed and stable path, and doesn\u2019t engage your stabilizer muscles - which is very important to build and maintain as you age).",

Sure you\u2019ll get some forearm action. They work decent for SLOW negative wrist curls. But that\u2019s about it. \n\nOn a barbell? Incredibly eh. More work for no benefit. Since the barbell spins in the sleeves you\u2019re not getting the stability work that a solid axel bar would provide. \n\nHere\u2019s a [cheap axel bar](https://titan.fitness/products/axle-barbells). Notice how it\u2019s a solid pipe? Well doing deadlifts with it, your forearms keep the bar/weights from spinning and *that* is what helps build forearms with barbell work. \n\nNow you do have blocks [like this](https://titan.fitness/products/leverage-block-loadable)\u2026some 1 handed some 2 handed\u2026.and these are a far better investment than fat gripz. \n\nHowever fat gripz are only 30$ so no harm in trying them if you want. \n\nIf you want forearms: \n\n- heavy deadlifts\n- pull ups\n- dead hangs\n- barbell rows\n- wrist curls\n- wrist extensions \n\nWork them just like any other muscle group. \n\nAnd for your hand gripper, I really like those for high rep stuff when watching tv or something. \n\nI have an adjustable one set to the lowest setting and will do 5 sets of 60 reps each hand. Great easy way to get a pump.",

Granted, I'm tall with an inordinately long limb-to-torso ratio, and that makes them seem smaller than they are, but still. Your calves look great. \n\nIf you really want my advice, though, I'll tell you what has worked for me and my clients in the past. Mine are a bit more defined than yours, though not as big relative to the rest of my leg. If you're looking for more definition, then keep reading. The calf is a bit different from most muscles. It doesn't get the same impact from the usual 8-12 rep range that works for, say, pecs. It tends to respond to rep ranges around 15-30 with a hold at the top of each rep. If that means you have to reduce weight, reduce weight. It doesn't look like you're going much higher than parallel to the floor here, so I would work on going higher. \n\n-Or-\n\nAnd here's where I would actually put my effort; walk. Just walk. While walking, be conscious of flexing your calves and taking them through the full range of motion. Even better if you wear a weighed vest or hiking pack. Even even better if you walk trails with inclines. When I lost 82 lbs by walking, I bought a weighed vest and put 5 lbs on it whenever I lost 5 lbs so that I could get the same effort with every hike. Eventually, I reached the 50lb limit of the vest, and that became my standard walking weight. My calves never looked better than they did at that point, neither before nor since.",

Think of like the very bottom of a preacher curl, or how using dumbbells to bench gives you more range of motion at the bottom compared to a barbell since you can go deeper to the sides of your chest.\n\nA lot of that research came with the calves. Even more interesting is that we even have studies showing only static stretching (I\u2019m talking unbearable amounts of time and pain) can induce hypertrophy in the calves.\n\nSo basically you should go as far down as you can on calves to the point where you really feel that \u201cstretch sensation\u201d and hold it for 3 seconds to ensure that stimulus.\n\nI promise you that people who complain that their calves aren\u2019t growing or just bouncing up and down or not going into the stretch.

I know this can still be a bit daunting so my advice would be to look out for the person that seems to know everybody and talks to everybody. That person likes talking and is nice enough that other people are happy to talk to that person. Every gym has a few of these people and aren't usually very hard to spot. \n\nUsually machines have names as well. Check them out online and it'll make things easier. I went to a different gym a couple weeks ago and I didn't know how to use a lot of the machines they had. \n\nKeep going, well done for having the maturity to be at a gym at your age.

Sadly, my gym is open 24 hours, I do go there late, and it\u2019s become a local teenager hangout for teens to socialize but not exercise.\n\nI mean, I was young once too.  It\u2019s great these teen boys and teen girls are socializing, meeting up in person, chatting and laughing and that\u2019s all great.  Since you can\u2019t go to bars, the gym is open late, I get it.  You\u2019d rather chat in person than online and I encourage that.  But do you have to block access to the leg curler while you\u2019re chatting? Or crowd around the treadmill next to mine while I\u2019m huffing and puffing away?\n\nMy request is, please don\u2019t block access to any equipment, and please give the old folks like me room to do their exercises.  So if there are 20 open empty treadmills, please don\u2019t all 6 of you stand atop the 1 treadmill next to mine.  Move to empty spaces of the gym.  Go to where no one else is or will be.  If you can do that, then that would be great.  Thanks.",

Your feet moved a little bit when you first lifted off but what I would say is most likely to improve your lift is bracing your core. \n\nThe same way you do for a squat or deadlift breath in deep and tense your core to make your trunk as solid as possible. That solid core is how the power from your leg drive makes it to the bar. \n\n\nGood stuff so far though",

Either you really force yourself into setting up a nice big arch or you tighten your grip a bit. Furthermore. Try pushing your elbows more to your torso instead of keeping them that flared. \n\nImportant: this is about moving weight tho! You would engage your shoulders more effectively and use less chest. This would be how to lift heavier, not how to lift \u201cbetter\u201d if you want to train chest. It\u2019s powerlifting, not Bodybuilding then.",

Start with your head off the bench, put your knees in a 90 deg angle (give or take), pull your chest to the bar (like an inverted row) and them position yourself with your eyes just behind the bar, taking pointer 1 into account still.

That means filling it up with air, in all directions, and then clenching your muscles like someone is going to punch you in the stomach. Keep that brace and learn to breathe while maintaining it. Usually just exhale and inhale at the top of each rep. Not only is this safer for your spine, but the rigidity lets you effectively transfer force through your abdomen from your feet. Get those feet planted firmly on the ground in a position where you can use them to push. This will generate tension in your legs,\nWhich can transfer through your core to your back. During setup, pull your shoulder blades together, and maintain that during the whole lift. Each rep, don\u2019t just lower the bar, but think about pulling it down and snapping it in half. This will let you pinch your shoulder blades together or keep them pinched, contributing to a solid base. This can improve your weight but, more importantly for you, the whole body rigidity will make the lift much more stable.   \n   \nBrace your core. Use *some* amount of leg drive (Keep your butt on the bench). Pinch your shoulder blades together.",

It's just that for all but a few years of that time when I would get in shape like this (well, not quite this level) I was overweight. I've just struggled with weight all my life since I was a little kid. I was always the \"fat kid\". The flip side of being fat is that I think I've always been pretty muscular, it was just hidden underneath fat. I always joke that I have to chip away the fat like a block of marble and reveal the statue inside.\n\nIf you already have muscle, the key thing during a diet like this over a long period is really not to lose it, or to lose as little as possible. I think I can say I've done a great job of that.\n\nThe other point I'd make about this is that it calls out the bullshit from influencers who say \"muscle burns so many calories you don't have to worry about cardio or diet\". That is absolute nonsense as my body can literally attest.",

The main thing is that you have to treat your calorie intake like a budget and figure out how to a) not go over budget while b) maximizing satiety/enjoyment. The way I do that will certainly be different from the way you do it. So what I would tell you is you need to do some experimentation to figure out what that diet looks like. If you can \"afford\" to have a donut every day or an old fashioned when you come home from work, while still meeting your calorie budget, by all means, you should do that. For me, that's just not a thing that was going to work, so I limit those indulgences to times when I go out with friends or have some kind of family occasion. But most days when I can control my food intake fully, you would probably call what I eat fairly \"boring\" but it's something I can live with. I've made sure of that. Hope this helps!",

It doesn\u2019t work.\n\nAnd if you did do the five day deload and hit it, you\u2019d be so incredibly fatigued your training would take a big hit. Unless you\u2019re in a rush it\u2019d be better to take it slow and hit it comfortably than to go balls to wall and risk, not only impairing your training, but also injury. When you max out constantly and leave no room for recovery your injury risk is going to be higher.\n\nAlso, since this just seems to be too heavy, a deload and then another attempt will have given you no time to actually build the strength for this. You need time to get stronger.",

Form is individual specific and subjective.  What works for one person doesn't necessarily work for another. A whole lot of records wouldn't count and a whole lot of top level competitors wouldn't be competitors in your world.\n\nTextbook form is about as useful as a manakin in a shop is for determining whether clothes will fit.

It's a curl, to target the biceps. That's like saying a push press isn't an overhead press. It isn't a strict bicep curl, but virtually every trained bicep movement doesn't fall within strict curl rules, and outside of that what constitutes a pr is completely up to the person doing the lifting.",

What this results in is a lack of consistent rep to rep form. In some reps, the bar travels forward and some times it seems to be OK.\n\nI would work on controlling the descent such that the first and last rep look exactly the same (not in intensity, but with consistent form). Lower the weight if you need to.\n\n2) Anytime someone starts to squat, I always tell them to play around with different stance widths and toe angle. Your form in your squat is dependent on your anatomy and there is no one singular \"correct\" form; just general guidelines. You're in the early stages of learning to squat so understanding what form works for you will allow you to progress.\n\n3) Bracing. I notice you actually do take a breathe before every rep which is awesome but you lack the rigidity that bracing actually provides in your reps (a lot of shaking and movement). Bracing is not just holding your breathe during the squat, it's a lot more than that. When you take a breathe, expand your belly (like a soda can; like how it's really rigid when it's closed) and you'll provide the ability to transfer the load through your body as one mechanism.",

I drink this throughout my time at the gym and much prefer it to BCAAs or Gatorade or any other mid workout nutritional drink. It helps me with my skin, my digestion, and dare I say my muscular endurance. This is pretty much the only supplement I take now besides whey and sometimes preworkout. People like to poke fun at me about the green stuff I\u2019m always drinking but I\u2019ll die on my hill. Was wondering if anyone has something similar that they mix up.",

Over time your balance and technique will improve. \n\nAlso as others have said, slow down the negative/lowering movement, then drive from your front foot a bit more. Split squats will use both legs even though staggered, and it should, but thinking about driving up with the front foot/leg may help - as well as a controlled slower negative/way down. \n\nDitching the running shoes may help while weight training also. There are lifting shoes and CrossFit style shoes you can get, but they are expensive. A good alternative is simply just either Vans or Converse. \nA shoe with a flat and stable sole. \n\nBut all in all, you\u2019re doing great - just keep practicing the exercise consistently and you will get better and balance will improve. \n\nAll the best!",

Starting from 0 and hitting 1 is a huge demand on your body to pull off. That's hitting PR 1Rep max level shit.\n\nBreak down the path between 0 and 1 to build yourself up. Its going to be rough for a few reps before it gets easier. 1 rep to 2 rep for example is a 100% increase, 2 rep to 3 rep is a 50% increase. Most of us work out in the ranges of 8-12reps for most exercises which are small to progress with. ie, increasing these sets with one rep isn't as intense to do as 8 reps > 9 reps = 12.5% increase while, 12 reps > 13 reps = 8% increase.\n\nKeep building up your strength in your lats & biceps. I weight 220 and can do 12 now. When I started I could barely do a half of one. The key for me was lots of heavy lifting exercises for lats and bicep curls in those higher reps including once in a while power lifting in the 3-5 range. Progressively overload these and over time you will have enough power to pull yourself up.\n\nThen its just a matter of adding pull ups themselves in your rotation and building further strength and technique directy with the exercise.",

If you dont have that then you should do other form of assisted pull ups like with bands or another person holding your feet etc. Im trying to say that best way to get good at pull ups is by doing them. Its that simple. \n\nI started with assisted pull ups and goal was to hit 12 until I lowered the assistance. My machine had 10kg progressions. So when I finally hit 12 pull ups with 10 kg assist, I moved to bodyweight and could do like 6-7. As soon I managed to do 10 clean BW pull-ups I started add wheight (5kg). Then goal was to hit 10 reps with that until I moved to 10 kg extra weight. After I moved to 15kg I lowered my rep requirement to 8 to start at 20kg weighted pull ups. Fast forward to now, so after 1,5 yrs I can do two plate weighted pull up.\n\nSo for me the key was to have progressive overload and more importantly keep the form correct: all the way up and all the way down. Granted I started at arond 70kg but clean form and progressive overload can help anyone. Good luck!",

The close movement to pull ups I have access are cable lat pulldown, one plate loading machine and another lat pulldown down machine with fixed weights. The last two always felt weird, probably because of fixed range of motion.\n\nI saw few people trying bands, but with my height (6'3) would be challenge to set them up. If my legs are straight I reaching the floor.\n\nHopefully by the end of the year I will be able to do pull ups working set.",

It is a powerful exercise for strengthening the hip extension necessary for athletes in strength sports like powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting, where the glute muscles play a crucial role in different movements.\n\nAs a powerlifter, the hip thrust is a go-to if I need to address glute specific weakness in my deadlifts or squats without tiring myself out for other accessory lifts.",

                "comment": "Firstly, I said \"isolation\" which means to target the specific muscle you want with minimal overlap. The glutes are the biggest and should be the strongest muscle in the body. Not including the fact that the quads are also working to extend the knee and the lumbar spine is also doing some work. All 3 muscles together produce ridiculous amounts of force. \n\nSecondly, \"the range of motion is poor\" that's an uneducated opinion. The job of the glute max is to  extend the hip. Your glutes full range of motion is thigh touching chest to thigh slightly behind parallel to torso. Although, Most people don't have the flexibility to touch their thigh to their chest. \n\nThirdly, a hip thrust is literally just an RDL movement in the horizontal plane except your knee is flexed limiting hamstring engagement (in the same way an ATG squat focuses on glutes and quads because the hamstring becomes a dynamic stabilizer). If you think the glutes RoM is poor during a RDL too, then I have a bridge I want to sell you. \n\nEdit: That said a conventional deadlift has a greater range of motion than the RDL because you can get lower and touch thigh to chest. this can be mimicked in a hip thrust by elevating your legs allowing you to sink deeper, but as I said, back elevated thrusts are the same range of motion RDLs go through. I have never seen anyone touch their thigh to chest in an RDL because your knees will flex greater than is accepted during an RDL, turning it into a regular deadlift.\n\nLastly, guys smaller than you and me have set records in lifting we never will. She's moving 400lbs because she trained to get there. Don't discount her effort. Can you hip thrust 400lbs? Since you're probably a significantly bigger person than her I'm expecting you can lift significantly more too with that criticism.\n\nEdit: name another exercise that's better glute isolation",

Exercise doesn't do much when it comes to excess fat, as you'll probably compensate by eating more anyways. \n\nAlso the only problem with fat is that it's quite dense, so especially in liquid form like oils it can add a lot of calories to an otherwise light meal, but usually it's sugars / carbs that will be the main thing to reduce from the diet.",

Also, the only macro you should focus on as a beginner (which I\u2019m assuming you are) is protein which should be at .8 to one gram per pound of body weight. The other figure you should focus on is total calories, regardless of macro source. \n\nA general rule of thumb to determine your maintenance calorie requirement (ie. the number of calories you need to function and neither gain nor lose weight) is multiply your body weight by 15. \n\nSo, your maintenance calories right now are 2,700, so no wonder you\u2019re not losing body fat. You\u2019re not eating in any sort of deficit, and you\u2019re probably eating in a surplus because you admit you\u2019re not tracking everything you ingest. You should subtract about 500 calories daily to lose about a pound of body fat per week. \n\nAs long as you keep your protein intake up, you can maintain (even gain a little) muscle while losing body fat - assuming your main goal is to lose body fat. If not, you can eat in a surplus, keep gaining muscle (as long as your program and consistency is legit - if not most of those calories will end up as body fat), and lose the fat later - but you may not like your look aesthetically during the gaining process.",

You're using a TON of energy to keep the spine aligned but with a belt you'll use just a little energy and have more left over for squatting.  Your abs need something to push against for maximum bracing \n\nI've never put that much on my back without a belt, ever.

St\u00e4rkezuwachs festgestellt haben.\n\nDu machst eine halb Kreuzheben, halbe row Variante mit ca. 54% deines 1RM DL gewichtes, das dies suboptimal ist, ist dir bewusst? Hinzu kommt, Rudern ist keine Wettkampf\u00fcbung, daher bringt es dir nichts, dort das meiste Gewicht zu bewegen.",

The balance issue is almost minimal now, thank God, but I still have two or three things I could fix (the quad work is in progress) \n\n1) should pull my chest out after unracking like I did in the video?\n\n2) I feel like my squats move like paused squats, I come to a dead spot at the bottom and then start another movement which might be a waste of energy. Do I need to overcome this or is it just something in my mind? \n\n3) if you see, the bar flies almost out of my back when my hips lockout. How do I prevent this? I don't want the bar to fall behind lol and it would be a problem on rep sets. But this might be because my hips are thrusting harder than needed",

Your knees are buckling in, because they are in the way of your arms. \n\nMove your feet closer. Not too much! The best set up for the right stance is to stand at the bar, squat down to grab it about shoulder width (could be a bit wider, but definitely not narrower). The outside of your knees should touch the inside of your elbows. This is actually not just physically the best starting point, but also pushing your knees to your elbow will help you to \"pull your strength together\" and to lift with good form.",

Jump into the air and where your feet land is likely your strongest base position. For your back, get your feet positioned as above, the bar over midfoot, then bend at the waist with your legs still straight until you can either grab the bar or get close. Only then should you start to bend your knees until you grab the bar, don\u2019t go any lower. Then brace, lock your lats pulling the bar close (you\u2019ll hear a little click at the point when the bar hits the plates). Then drive up. Reverse the effort on the way back down. \n\nAs you\u2019re learning I recommend resetting each time you go to do a new rep. Also, drop the squishy shoes, you can see how your ankles are wobbly in them as they don\u2019t distribute weight across your foot evenly.\n\nGood luck!",

That can happen from most exercises yes but deadlift is in a category of its own. \n\nI love deadlifts because I am an engineer who sits a lot and they absolutely deleted my back pain, but let\u2019s not pretend like there isn\u2019t risk.  If I am feeling tired, I will skip deadlifts for sure.  You could breathe a little wrong or do 1 too many reps and be seriously injured.  It\u2019s a great lift, which most people should be doing, but i firmly believe you should also be afraid of it.

Yes and that is a common situation with people who are starting to lift.  Obviously now I am not going to get hurt with 135.

You underestimate how fragile people who don\u2019t do deadlifts are.  \n\nReally you can get hurt doing any exercise and you should have a healthy fear for pretty much everything you do imo.

And yes, I train the conjugate method. As I\u2019m sure you know a huge part of that is cycling through movements to avoid the law of accommodation. So this variation will be in the mix for a few weeks before being subbed out for something else. \n\nA huge benefit I find with this movement is that the instability doesn\u2019t just work the muscles but works the mind muscle connection as well. You\u2019re forced to constantly keep reminding yourself to keep tight or you will get whipped out of position. So as someone with relatively weak shoulders AND someone who tends to lose tightness during bench this variation works wonders for me.",

                "comment": "MY ROUTINE: PUSH PULL LEGS REST, REPEAT \n\n(this is alternating 5 and 6 days in the gym per week), if you want to do push pull legs push pull legs rest ,repeat that will fit it into a 7 day span, but i prefer the extra rest day. More rest helps with the gains imo and this is an intense split if done right. ALSO FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE EAT ENOUGH PROTEIN AND FOOD IN GENERAL i eat to failure also, i actually eat more now than when i was (slightly) overweight before. ANYWAYS:\n\nWorkout 1 - Push\n- [ ] dumbbell Bench Press 4X5 - 7 (first 2 sets warm up, last 2 working sets)\n- [ ] Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press 3 X 6 - 8\n- [ ] Incline Dumbbell Press 3 X 8 - 10 \n- [ ] Side Lateral Raises 2 X 10 - 12 \n- [ ] one arm Triceps Pressdowns 2 X 8 - 10 \n- [ ] Overhead Triceps Extension 2 X 8 - 10 \n\nWorkout 2 - Pull\n- [ ] Bent-over Row 4 X 5-7 (2 warm up sets, 2 working sets)\n- [ ] lat pull downs 3X6-8 \n- [ ] dumbbell Shrugs 3 X 8 - 10 \n- [ ] Face Pulls 2 X 10 - 12 \n- [ ] Barbell Bicep Curl 2 X 8 - 10 \n- [ ] Dumbbell Hammer Curl 2 X 8 - 10 \n\nWorkout 3 - Legs/Abs\n- [ ] smith machine Squats 4 X 6 - 8 (2 warm up sets, 2 working sets)\n- [ ] smith machine Romanian Deadlifts 2 X 8 - 10 \n- [ ] Leg Press 2 X 10 - 12 \n- [ ] Leg Curl 2 X 10 - 12 \n- [ ] Calf Raise (machine) 4 X 8 - 10 \n- [ ] Hanging Leg Raise 2 X 10 - 15 (however many reps it takes to hit failure)\n\nAll this take about an hour - an hour and 10 mins if you\u2019re resting for ample time between sets. Last rep should be to absolute failure except on the warm up sets. Rest for 3+ minutes each exercise (except warmups) so you can lift as heavy for the same amount of reps as your previous set. If each workout is done in order each exercise will warm up for the next, so that\u2019s why i only warm up on my first exercise. I\u2019ve been doing this with progressive overload as well (ex, bench press weight should be heavy enough to be hitting absolute failure at 5-7 reps. as soon as you can do 8-10 reps, time to up the weight until you fail again at 5-7)\n\nfeel free to tweak it, use bars instead of dumbbells or whatever works for you. If you decide to use the bar on push day for example, i\u2019d recommend using the bar on all the exercises and not flip flopping between bar and dumbbells. Pick one and stick with it\n\nThis is at least what worked for me. Been doing this split for 3 months and it is responsible for 90% of my gains",

You seem young and light; seeing the weight be that stable in someone your age is a rarity.\n\nAs a closing point, the weight you\u2019re using seems easy for you. I\u2019d bump it up to 20\u2019s and see how that feels. If muscle growth is your goal, pick a weight you can do for roughly 5 to 30 repetitions.",

This is the reason why you should try \"breaking the bar\" technique, which is really close to the form you are using right now. \n\nEvery body is different and you have to discover what techniques and exercises help you the most in the career path to your goal.",

This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing though, my recommendation is to mirror that with your left. What I mean is this: at the bottom of the rep, pause and completely relax into a dead hang with both arms. Then, for the next rep, retract shoulder blades and THEN start the pull. This may teach the shoulder girdle to move better from contracted to relaxed, and may help with symptoms.",

I can say similar thing considering grip, most people prefer slightly wider grip which helps a lot with weight. It helps if your shoulders allow you wider grip. I don't know if you arched your back, I can't see it in the video. If you didn't arch your back you might want to try that too. It helps with leg drive. \nYou can try this approach and see if it works for you: \n1. Basically sit on the bench with toes slightly pointing out\n2. Lie down so top of your head is even with bench end\n3. Grab bar with thumbs pointing each other so that top of the thumb is where smooth surface of the bar transitions to rough surface of the bar (that's like few cms more than you grip now), after ensuring grip width place thumbs how you like.\n4. Push yourself slightly  with your legs while \"trying to bend\" a bar with your arms and lift your upper body with your arms while pushing it towards your hips.\n5. Push your upper body towards your hips until your eyes are below bar.\n6. Squeeze your scapulas and place top of your scapulas firmly into bench.\n7. Take a breath, brace and lift weight from bench rack.\n8. Exhale, take a deep breath, brace, and lower bar with control on your preferred place (just below nipples recommend so it's balanced between triceps, pecs and shoulders).\n9. Once bar touches body drive with your legs and explode up. Or you can pause it for second or more if it's not pr. \nYou should be able to lift a bit more if that technique suits you, if it doesn't worst part would be losing few minutes trying. Using this technique only two points touching bench should be your glutes and top of your scapulas. Powerlifters use this quite a lot.",

If those are your max then you are activating all the necessary components to build strength and size.\n\nI started with a single half pull up, couldn't even get to the bar. Without losing much weight since, I can rock 10 now. (220lbs).\n\nRemeber at low reps, one rep is a big difference. The time it took me to get from 1 rep to 2 rep was significantly longer than the time it took me to get from 9 to 10. Thats the difference of 100% increase vs 10% increase. Count half reps. \n\nGranted I wasn't doing strickly calisthenics, I did alot of lat exercises that didn't require my bodyweight to pull... like lat pulldowns, bicep curls, etc in addition to the pull ups. Perhaps you need to do more volume with lighter intensity in the mix for the size? \nie:\n- Push ups from a higher elevation like a bar to decrease the weight or being on your knees instead of toes...\n- As for pull ups, do it from a bar with an angle where the ball of your foot touches the floor. Work up to using one leg and floating the other for added weight for progressive overload.\n\nGoing to failure with these at a much higher rep should help with some additional hyperthrophy. Atleast for pullups, I think your push up range is already in the sweet spot for it.",

Take a look at the \"Russian Fighter Pull Up\" program, but apply it to your push ups.

                "comment": "I know some people will tell you to just keep banging your head against the wall until you get more reps--and that might work for them--but it appears that it's not working for you. \n\nIf three reps is your max on pull-ups, it's going to be very hard to progress by continuing to just do pull-ups. Think about it, in order to get better at pull ups, you need to do more pull ups (i.e, volume) - but if you max out at 3, it's nearly impossible to get the volume you need to improve. You will have to do many sets, and to rest long periods of time between sets since you're maxing out.\n\nI would suggest taking it easy on pull ups and focusing on assistance stuff. Lat pulldowns, bicep curls, shoulder exercises. 3-4 sets of a given movement. 8-15 reps per set. 2-3 times per week. And if you want to train to failure--I would save that for your last set on a given movement. Training to failure is great for hypertrophy--but it's not ideal for building pure strength and can slow down your progress if you overdo it. Most smart programming requires you train within some range of failure -- but since beginners don't know how to actually gauge what failure is, the advice they're given is to just go to failure all the time. \n\nRenaissance Periodization has a great pull up progression program for various levels of pull up strength. Look it up on youtube and it should get you where you need to go. \n\nGood luck!",

Your heels are coming up because the bar is pathing forward of midfoot a bit and you are losing your balance.  Watch the video and watch where the bar is at when you are at the bottom.  It should be directly over midfoot.  However, it is out over your toes.  You need to keep your torso slightly more vertical or move the bar down your back a tiny bit and that'll solve your heel issue.",

I can't tell quite what's going on with your feet from that angle, it looks like heels are coming up a bit but also like they're also coming in, which is interesting since your knees don't look to be. Might want to play a bit with your foot spacing to see if you can find something else. Might also want to try elevating your heels a bit.\n\nYour chest isn't falling forward as much as your hips are coming up first, then you have to do a bit of a good morning to get it up so your bar path isn't straight up and down, it kind of goes up and to the left from the perspective of the video. Working on bracing and getting that whole area stronger will help with that.\n\nMostly small details, overall they're pretty solid squats.",

                "comment": "I would argue that she should accept it and let her torso lean a bit more to keep the midfoot position. As she starts the descent she is arching her back and then is running out out of flexion at the hip so she needs to shift her weight forward and on to her toes in order to keep balance. If she has a bit more of a ribs down brace at the start and allows her chest to fall forward a bit then she might not max out on hip flexion quite as early and will be more balanced. This would pair nicely with a more lowbar position like you suggested. Trying to keep a more vertical torso right now will likely just end up in more of the same issue.\n\n  \nChest falling forward and hips going back isn't a bad thing in the squat and accepting it can help to decrease how much it happens since the body doesn't need to try to correct the positioning as much. So there will be less shifting at the bottom and better midfoot pressure.\n\nAlso, you are right that they aren't coming up from a lack of mobility but putting a plate under her heels/wearing heeled shoes would definitely help with decreasing overall shifting of foot pressure and allow for better midfoot pressure. So it could be a quick fix in the short term but the \"fix\" shouldn't end there.\n\n  \nAlternatively she might also benefit from pointing her toes out or a wider stance so that she can keep a more vertical torso without trying to arch her back",

Very big on meat based diets and eggs. At the beginning I made sure to bulk as much as i could sort of a dirty bulk (went to chipotle literally everyday no exaggeration) but i still kept a mental count of my calories\u2026 I weighed myself at 212 peak bulk at 5\u20199. Then towards the end of my first year of lifting I started introducing more actual weight-in foods and measured them and what not, this helped kinda to manipulate my weight and intake, lots of foods deviated from online youtube videos; i would structure my food around what my idols ate ofc this was a mistake not knowing most of them were on juice\u2026 but i quickly learned and measured my calorie count wiser.",

Possibly 200 deal with athleticism experts think now. And you cannot tell one bit how those genes are expressed just because someone is better than you at something.\n\nIn 30 years of going to the gym, I have met one guy not on steroids who deadlifts over 600 raw. If you saw him, you would not call him a genetic outlier. He is an unathletic looking dufus who deadlifts 4 days a week, squats 1, and avoids the silly leg machines. He is in his late 20's. He trains 50 weeks a year for the last 10 years. That is not GENETICS.\n\nI am 43 years old. As a youth people teased me for being skinny. I am now 5'10, 250lbs, not on steroids, with average to short arms. I can deadlift 590 raw, I can squat 505 and bench 410. It has taken me 15 years of years of lifting 5 or 6 days a week and being in a permanent bulk. Since Covid I have been deadlifting/bench press/barbell rowing 3 days a week, and squatting/overhead pressing 3 days a week, with one day dedicated to long walks and stretching. \n\nMorons have said I was blessed with great genetics. When I started 15 years ago I weighed 182 pounds and couldn't bench 205, squat 315 or deadlift 405.",

The loss in tightness is also causing you to lean forward slightly right before you initiate the rep which will cause more problems at heavier weights especially. \n\nOverall looks decent though but you need to be going slightly deeper to hit proper depth. Unfortunately you\u2019re team long femurs similar to myself so it will be more difficult to. Regardless, hip crease should be parallel or lower than top of your knee",

        "content": "Hey there. Today I had a rather scary situation at my gym. \n\nIt was the first time somebody asked me to spot them. I said yes and went ahead. The guy was going to  bench-press 75 kg. My PR is 60kg, but I thought it wouldn't be a problem because I assumed that during a spot, you're not actually lifting all the weight yourself, maybe not even half the weight.\n\nThe guy started benching and it was all good. He managed to get the reps he told me he'd go for and tried to do one more. During all this time, I kept my hands above the bar (not touching it) because it seemed he was doing pretty well. Last rep he just gave in very fast, so I rushed to grab the bar and that's when the \"Scary\" part happened: I was basically pulled down by the bar as well and struggled to get it up. We both managed to lift it enough and put it on the safety stop. The guy didn't complain or anything and just said thanks. For his next reps, he took off 10kg and he was achieving it easily, so he didn't ask me to spot again.\n\nAfter that I came up with a few questions:\n\n1) Is it a bad idea to accept a spot for a weight that goes above your PR?\n\n2) Is it safer to try to grab the bar by wrapping your hands \"below\" or \"above?\n\n3) What's a good way to reject a spot if you don't feel confident you'll manage it?",

Saying exactly what you typed: \"I don't feel confident I can lift that if it goes wrong.\" \n\nNEVER - AND I MEAN NEVER - try to stop the bar from actively going down on a bench press. Every bencher should assume/know the risk involved. A spotter is there for two reasons: A - the bar is stalled in the air and the lifter is making no progress towards completing the rep, B - ASSIST in getting the bar off of the lifter. The lifter cannot expect to not help lift the bar off of them. If that is a possibility use a rack with safety bars and a bench you can move  into the rack, or USE MULTIPLE SPOTTERS.\n\nI am not trying to lambaste a lot of younger people. But this is the problem with the current era of gym use. I am 43 years old. I took weightlifting class in high school, was an athlete in high school and college and have used gyms ever since. These are the \"rules\" of free weights that were passed down. Social media and influencers haven't done a good job of expounding what a spotter is for.",

                "comment": "I spotted a powerlifter benching 500lb once and even if he couldn't get it up, i could at least deadlift part of it.  Some questions to ask when spotting a new person:\n\nHow many reps are you going for?\nDo you want a lift off?\nDo you want me to help if you go beyond failure?\nHave you ever done this weight before?\n\nWhen spotting be alert and instead of hovering your hands above the bar and potentially touching it and affecting the rep, try to keep your hands about 5-6 inches above the bar and keep them over the person's neck or head towards the top of the lift and below the bar height.  If you assume that the person will fail half way or higher then the likelihood of it coming down on their neck or head is much worse and therefore you should watch for that.  If someone fails at the bottom of the lift then the bar will come down on their chest and only fall a few inches.",

Only thing I'd say which isn't necessarily better, just different, is to have an even deeper angle to start, about 50-55 degrees which allows the bar to go just behind the head and hit the long head tricep even harder. It's easier on an incline and will take the shoulders out of as they might be the limiting factor if the arm angle is extreme.",

No reason to change things, no matter how much I long for the 1-3 rep sets.\n* 160kg high bar squat, for the 3rd time ever. That's the second time since returning to heavy squatting.\n* I found a rough 10RM on 1.5 rep front squats at 80kg. I'll use 70 for a cautious 10RM for the next 12 weeks.\n* Deadlift maxtest didn't go great. 175 for 7, matching my PR - BUT I'd had a wonderful squat workout the night before and was behind on sleep, so I'll take it.\n   * And what better way to make up for that than hitting a Zercher DL PR at 135?\n* I've planned out the next 12-week block of deadlifts and rows: 5/3/1 BBBRS for rows, Greg Nuckols' deadlift singles progression, and BBBRS for deadlift. Maybe having a fixed 12-week structure with interlocking programs will be the key to me actually doing my rows?",

Working out at the gym isn't something I naturally enjoy, but I know I want to get healthier, so I push myself to go. Since I started lifting heavier weights, I've noticed that I need a minute or two to catch my breath between sets. Instead of just standing around, I've developed a habit of tidying up the gym. For example, if a 30-pound dumbbell is in the 10-pound spot, I'll move it back, or I'll put away resistance bands and kettlebells that others have left out.\u00a0\n\nThe gym always looks much more organized when I'm done, but I've received mixed feedback from people I know about this habit.\u00a0\nSome think it's great because everything ends up in its proper place, but others worry that I might unintentionally upset people. They think I could be making others feel ashamed for not putting their equipment away, even though that's not my intention. So, I'm curious\u2014would you be annoyed, weirded out, or happy if you saw a burly guy with a beard cleaning up the gym between his sets?",

But after being at this gym for about 6 months, it has been a terrible experience, and I see how scummy this gym is. I can not get ahold of the gym owner or anything, and they keep refusing to let me get a copy of the contract I signed. This month I had to disable my card because my accounts had been compromised by a hacker and in the settings it says don't allow purchases  except for reoccurring payments but I found out I did not get charged this month. So I have been trying to get ahold of the owner for 2 weeks and the owner answered one time and she said that she was too busy at the moment and the worker said I am probbally going to have to pay multiple overcharge fees plus my gym paymenst totalling over 100 dollars just for 2 months which I dint understandwhy I cant just pay the gym mebership fee and why is it so much for 2 months?. I should have never signed this gym contract it barely has any equipment or anything and as soon as I saw the owner I knew she was a mean lady.She is like the most Karen person I have ever seen. The first time I seen her because I wanted to change the contract from a couple to a single I overheard her on the phone harassing other people about overcharge fees and how she is going to send them to collections. This gym has been so scummy with fees everywhere, like a 50 dollar join fee, and she even moved locations of the gym and I could not go for 1 month, and I still had to pay. I asked her If I could make it where I auto leave the gym after my contract is up and she said I have to tell her 30 days ahead but I just know that it is going to be really difficult trying to get out of this contract dealing with this women. Any advice on what I should do? I am really considering just trying to pay the whole 2 year payments so I can do away with it but I won't even be able to go anymore if I do that she said and I will basically be giving her free money.",

It always fails when my first arm feels like it has 3-4 RIR on exercises such a dumbbell bench/incline/ lat raises/ tricep, better much anything that requires are strength. particularly frustrated now as i nearly hit a PR on bench but my left arm failed to get all the way up. Is this normal? any tips for closing the gap?\nThanks",

Progressive overload, usually to failure, keeping weight in the 3-10 rep range depending on exercise. Usually 3-5 for big/compound movements. 3-5 sets/exercise. Usually about 3 exercises per muscle group.\n\nBut what I've noticed is that for a lot of my regular chest/back exercises I'm not really sore/exhausted after anymore, or the next day. So my question - am I doing enough/am I leaving gains on the table? If I'm not as tired/sore as I used to be, is that a sign I should add sets and/or exercises? \n\nI've avoided doing blocks/concentrating on specific muscle groups each day so far bc I can afford 2 hours in the gym/day - which lets me hit most of my body every time. Should I switch to a given program with these kinds of focuses?",

                "comment": "# I need help and guidance for I am very confused with my supposed calorie intake calculation.\n\nI have recently started my journey earlier this month to a totally differently lifestyle (more active, less gaming etc) to better myself. I am 33 years old male, 160kg and 178cm. I used to be a sedentary person for the past 6-7 years that does nary an exercise (which ballooned me) and when I went to check my supposed calorie intake from this website ([https://tdeecalculator.net/](https://tdeecalculator.net/)), it mentioned\u00a0**3,063**\u00a0calories per day for maintenance and\u00a0**2,563**\u00a0calories per day for cutting/losing weight.\n\nHowever, like I've mentioned earlier, I started my journey of changing of lifestyle and jolted up my daily routine and went to the gym 6x a week doing the Arnold Split (Chest/Back, Shoulder/Arm, Legs) since August 1st. When I changed my input, my TDEE changed to\u00a0**4,403**\u00a0calories per day for maintenance and\u00a0**3,903**\u00a0calories per day for cutting/losing weight.\n\nCurrently, I am consuming 4x Whey Protein shakes with 1x whatever meal a day and strictly nothing after 6pm - to be under\u00a0**1,500**\u00a0calories per day for that's what I've learnt way back then when I lost weight under my secondary school (highschool) PE teacher guidance when he was training me for my 42km marathon then (was around 80kg then) 10 years back. I have no issues with my current 'diet'/'consumption' for I do not see nor view it as a 'crash diet', I am actually vibing with it although I could do less Whey Protein as that gives me random stomachache from time to time. I still would love to eat a bit more to try to hit my protein intake at least which is currently\u00a0**256g/390g**.\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n* Does maintenance means that if I consume those amount of calories, I will stay the same weight?\n* Does doing 1 hour+ of gym, 6x a week truly allows me to consume\u00a0**1,340**\u00a0more calories even if I am cutting?\n* If I want to do the 'healthier' approach, do I truly have to consume\u00a0**2,563**\u00a0(Sedentary) or\u00a0**3,903**\u00a0(Heavy Exercise) calories?\n* How much does 'heavy exercise' means? I do not think of 1 hour, 6x a week as 'heavy' even if I were to do high volume of weightlifting\n* Last but not the least, my goal is to lose 60kg first (fast?) before recomping to 90kg. It's more of a psychological factor so that I can 'see' the change and motivate myself even further.",

In one of them, on the first upper body workout they only do one exercise for a muscle, and then a different exercise for the same muscle on the second upper body workout. Is this actually effective as there is like 2 days in between and you aren\u2019t fully training the muscle each day?",

I was studying at the time and working part time. During the lockdown my gym closed for 3 months. During those three months, I would go for a walk everyday. The walking helped me lose weight. Come 2024, I\u2019ve gained muscle for sure but I\u2019ve also gained belly fat specially lower belly. My eating habits are not very good because I have a hard time preparing my food. I need some motivation and help with food that\u2019s easy to prepare/doesn\u2019t take too long. Something to keep me energized but also help me to lose weight. Since May this year, I haven\u2019t been very consistent with the gym because I\u2019m tired. I work 7 days a week. The only day off I get is a statutory holiday. Please give me some advice that\u2019s realistic to achieve. I\u2019m very frustrated with my belly fat. Thank you. I have attached a link to show the changes over the years.

Last Christmas, I was fully committed to my workouts until I had to take several months off due to illness. At that time, I had a near-perfect program, routine, and diet.\n\nI've slowly been getting back to the same pace I had in December. I\u2019ve now been training consistently for a month, working out 5 hours a week on strength training and 3 hours on running, with a 500-calorie deficit. Dieting is easy for me; I'm lazy about cooking and don\u2019t buy any snacks to keep at home. This doesn\u2019t mean I eat poorly. When I\u2019m in the mood, I spend hours in the kitchen preparing good meals to stock in the freezer and fridge for later enjoyment (last time, I asked ChatGPT for a new recipe idea, so I made a lentil-beef stew with rice\u2014a plate almost full of food with only 200 calories).\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve started to think about why I\u2019m working so hard and what motivates me. I haven\u2019t had much luck in relationships, so I\u2019ve decided to focus on investing in my own happiness and health. As silly as it sounds, I want to get visible abs and post a transformation picture on Instagram (I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll actually do it, but the thought is motivating). I\u2019ve also mentioned that I want to compete in an Ironman, although with my current appearance, not many people believe me when I say that in passing (my progress is visible everywhere, but thanks to my lovely genes, I still have a belly that could be described as a balloon. My abs are starting to show, but the fat is the last to go. Even my jawline has become more defined and sexy, if I may say so myself).\n\n**What motivates you?**",

I got the basic layout;\n\nMon: Chest & Tri  \nTues: Back & Bi  \nWen: Off Day - Muay Thai  \nThur: Legs  \nFri: Shoulders & Traps  \nSat: Off Day - Muay Thai  \nSun: Off Day\n\nI just need help finding good and effective exercises, there's an overwhelming amount of movements and I just want the opinion from someone that's been working out for a hot second now.\n\nA big exclamation is that I have some weird problem with both my knees, much more my right, in which when its under load it has this tight painful feeling, I believe its my knee cap and leg extensions and squats really trigger it, which from my understanding standing are the best movements for the quads, so yeah :(\n\nAnyways if its needed I'm about 16 y/o 155Lbs 5'8 and I'm probably sitting around 25%-27% body fat I don't even know, I'm probably really off.\n\nGive any advice, recommendation, or tips, all are appreciated",

I take one day off between each workout, and tend to lift pretty heavy 6-10 reps close to exhaustion each set of 3-4 sets.\n\nI\u2019ve recently come to realise that by training shoulders with legs I\u2019m effectively training triceps twice a week, which I think has led to some overtraining. My bench has been feeling a bit shaky and I took a week off with a cold and felt much stronger after training push.\n\nMy question is, when do you train shoulders?\n\nI tried fitting it into my chest tri workout today, but was absolutely gassed by the time I finished my usual chest/tri workout and could only OHP half the usual amount.\n\nDo I need to take more time off between workouts, or perhaps add in another leg day?\n\nFor context I\u2019m a 34 natty lifter who\u2019s been lifting weights 17 years, so happy to hear some advanced takes on this\n\nCheers",

Years later, between my job, studying and everything else, I have very little time and energy left.\n\nHowever, I bought an adjustable bench and some dumbbells, ranging from 8kg to 24kg (18 to 52 pounds I believe).

To lose weight you have to 1) pick an arbitrary number of calories (lets say 3000 per day), 2) eat that amount for a week or two, 3) monitor weight on a weekly basis, 4) adjust calories accordingly (if weight isn't going down - lower calorie intake by 10-20%), 5) repeat until you reach your goal.\n\n> I still would love to eat a bit more to try to hit my protein intake at least which is currently 256g/390g.\n\nYou [don't actually need that much protein](https://mennohenselmans.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/), but that's up to you.\n\n> Does maintenance means that if I consume those amount of calories, I will stay the same weight?\n\nYes.\n\n> Does doing 1 hour+ of gym, 6x a week truly allows me to consume 1,340 more calories even if I am cutting?\n\nCalories burned from exercise are wildly inaccurate. That's why you should not be accounting exercise for your calorie intake at all. Ignore calories burned from exercise. Just focus on eating your set amount of calories.\n\n> do I truly have to consume 2,563 (Sedentary) or 3,903 (Heavy Exercise) calories?\n\nThe amount of calories you need is dictated by your goals. If you want to lose weight - you have to [eating in a calorie deficit](https://thefitness.wiki/weight-loss-101/). If you want to gain strength/size - you have to [eating in a calorie surplus](https://thefitness.wiki/muscle-building-101/).\n\n> How much does 'heavy exercise' means?\n\nThat is absolutely irrelevant. You only calculate your TDEE *once* (to get a rough estimate) and that's it. But even that isn't necessary, you can pick any number of calories you want (just 1 number). Then you eat that amount of calories for a week or two, measure your weight, adjust calorie intake accordingly.\n\n> my goal is to lose 60kg first\n\nAgain, all you need is a calorie deficit. Take an arbitrary number of calories (lets say 3000), eat that amount for a week or two, measure weight on a weekly basis, if you didn't lose weight - reduce calorie intake by 10-20%.",

                "comment": "Let's start with this: tdee calculation is not more than a very, very rough estimation and off by quite a bit. The more your body(-compositon) deviates from the average, the worse it gets. I am not quite as heavy as you but closer than most, taller and exercise quite a bit. Cutting on 4000 kcal? Not gonna happen.\n\nSame goes for exercise expenditure: I have seen people who probably don't burn more than 100kcal extra during one hour of their workout. Others burn a lot more... Depends on: what you are doing and how good your body is at it. You are not in shape, so your body does not have the work capacity trained people have. You won't be able to get in the oxygen your body needs to use that amount of energy reserves... Burning 1000 kcal in an hour is REALLY hard. And all that \"Oh, but you are less efficient as a newbie, so you burn more...\" is nonsense. You can burn what your body can process.\n\nSo, to steer my rant in a more productive direction: start with a reasonable number of calories. Doesn't really matter if its 2000 or 3000. Keep that number constant for a while, live your life and train. See what happens to your weight and then adjust from there.",

Don't count on them, ever, outside of using them as a rough guideline in the beginning.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\n* 1kg bodyweight \\~= 7600 calories. I like to round it to 7000 - it's close enough, and it gets the job done.\n* So to lose 1kg in a week, you need a weekly deficit of 7000 calories, or 1000/day. To lose 0.5kg, 500/day.\n* You take an estimate - **any** halfway reasonable estimate - and calculate based off that.\n* Let's say you pick a calculation that gives you a TDEE of 3000 calories/day. You aim for a weight loss of 500g/week, meaning a deficit of 500 calories/day, so you set your intake at 2500/day.\n* Weigh yourself multiple times a week, preferably daily under similar circumstances (I like in the morning after my first visit to the toilet). Your weight can fluctuate on a daily basis, so you don't use the daily weights but the weekly averages.\n* If your weight trends down 500g/week you're on target. If you lose more or less than that, either make peace with the pace or add/subtract calories.\n* Your TDEE has some elasticity, and will also change with activity levels and weight. It may be 3000 now, but drop to 2600 once you've lost a bit of weight. Keep adjusting over time (or just do it every couple of months).\n* Your daily intake includes everything. Milk and sugar in your coffee, fats used for cooking, etc.",

But this is not always the case because individual leverages play an important role. \n\nThe same increase in ROM that allows for greater hamstring activation for some people might actually hit the quads a bit more for other people. This is not to say that the hamstrings will be left behind for the latter group, but this will have certain implications as per your question.\n\nBut for general purposes all of that doesn't matter.

It's just a very long lever and a rather small muscle, so the weight is small. Which also means that the relative jump from one weight to the next is really big. Add 5lbs to your 100 lbs bench and you increased the weight by 5%. Add 5 lbs to your 15 lbs lateral raises and you made a 33% jump.\n\nSo you will hang out A LOT longer at a given weight and just progress by adding volume. Add a set here and there or do a double progression or whatever to continuously increase stress until you are ready to do the jump.",

Repeat indefinitely.\n\nMaintaining is only useful if you 1) don't want to build more muscle and 2) you don't want to lose fat.

Some people handle big, immediate changes well, others do well with building it in smaller increments and adding more over time.\n\nNot knowing specifically what you're struggling with, here are some ideas:\n\n* For working out, find some activity that you like\n* For diet, experiment with recipes and find something healthy that you like, and stick with that\n* If you're struggling with managing your weight, it can help to track what and how much you're eating. **Unless** you have some eating disorder - you'll want to have a professional involved in that case.\n* Experiment with making dietary substitutions. Doesn't have to be perfect, just has to be better.\n* Think of adding instead of subtracting. If you eat a lot of low calorie vegetables, you may be too full to eat a lot of higher calorie stuff.\n* Think about habit bundling. You can bundle some stuff you **should** do with stuff you **like to** do. I hate doing ab work, so I do it between sets of bench press.\n* Combining the previous two points, maybe if you have some coffee or tea you'll start thinking of all the delicious stuff (chocolate, cookies, etc.) that go well with it - but if you substitute the coffee/tee for something like green tea you may not get the same associations.\n* Practice forgiving yourself when you slip up. One small misstep generally doesn't offset months of weight loss, and a single skipped workout doesn't set you months back. Get back on track tomorrow.\n* Finally, sleep more. Making the right decisions get easier, cravings get easier, pushing yourself during workouts gets easier.",

Starting way back with a 12RM or something around that mark, then adding 2.5kg per workout - up to 5 times per week. The rest is a bit bastardized: with the same template I do overhead presses instead of one-arm presses (since... well... I want a bigger overhead press) and then depending on how I feel I tack on 10-15 min of bodyweight stuff (Dips or Chin-up progression, super-setted with easy isolation stuff like hammer curls or lateral raises)\n\nAnd I ramped up to the 5 times a week since it has been a long time since I deadlifted with higher frequency, sticking to the once per week or even every other week methodology... And I have to say I feel amazing. Not in a \"Oh, look at my muscles\" or \"Hey another PR!\" type of way, but the feeling outside the gym is what amazes me.",

My mood and mental health took a complete 180, with one of the biggest reasons being, for the first time in my life: I'm not hungry.  I used to eat something every 30 minutes and basically have my life revolve around food, and that has since stopped.  I'm also the leannest I've ever been naturally for a LONG time (natural not just in the sense of \"without drugs\", although I AM also off caffeine because of this, but meaning that I'm not TRYING to be lean), my digestion is finally healed (having gone from 6 bloody stools a day to 1 normal human one), and I'm flat out LOVING the cuisine.

It doesn't make sense to worry about exactly what the value of d is when the variable you're interested in is X.\n\nSet a weight loss or calorie target that feels sustainable, aim for that, keep your activity level up, and adjust intake over time to match your rate of weight loss to your goal.",

So in terms of bulking, you just take those foods and eat more of them.\n\n> always had trouble gaining weight\n\nThe key thing to realize is that your body always adapts to what you do. If you're not a big eater to begin with - your appetite will be lower. But if you eat *beyond* your natural appetite - your body will adapt, and your appetite will increase.\n\nSo if you're having a hard time eating more - eat a bit more anyway, and then a bit more. And eventually your appetite will go up. Also check out r/gainit for more information.\n\n> don\u2019t want to take the \u201cdirty bulk\u201d\n\nI really don't like this term. A bulk is a bulk, and you eat what you eat. There are no inherently bad foods. We can't even clearly define what a \"healthy diet\" is.

You'll probably need them for full development in terms of aesthetics, but for strength you may never need them.\n\nOkay, there is one main consideration here: How many joints does a muscle cross?\n\nSome muscle heads (there's one each in the quads, triceps and biceps, three in the hamstrings, and a bunch outside of that) that cross two joints.\n\nFor biceps, triceps and quads that means you'll generally want something where the movement is mainly around the knees/elbows to hit the long heads (curls, triceps extensions, leg extension, stuff like that) on top your compound lifts. For hamstrings that's leg curls on top of your compound lifts.\n\nYou may also want to add in some unilateral work in some periods.\n\n**All of this** is something you'll want over time. You don't need all of it all of the time, or every single workout. It takes less to maintain a muscle than it takes to build it, and just maintaining is perfectly fine while you're focusing on other stuff.",

                "comment": "They are not too important. Yes, they are a great exercise and one can get a lot out of it. But you are also correct, that 99% is not good enough. No use in 99 perfect deadlifts when you fuck up every 100th rep and injure yourself. Also the mental burden is probably not worth it since it is important to have some form of enthusiasm for your training.\n\nOne thing I just want to throw out there which is absolutely counterintuitive but might actually work for your situation: deadlifting A LOT more often. Basically treating it as skill practice and dedicating 10 minutes of every workout to the deadlift. But to enable that frequency, you have to drop volume and intensity. No trashing yourself in a set, no grinders... Just working up to a few crisp, moderately heavy reps (think of something like a set of 3 with 80% or a set of 5 with 70%). This allows for a focus on setup and technique and reduces the chance of injury quite a lot. Also it is easier to do something right when you do it 3-4 times a week than doing it once a week (which turns into every 2nd week if you regularly miss the workouts or whatever). But that is not a \"Don't drop them, do this instead!\", just one thing I learned that works for me (as a former deadlift-hater myself), so I wanted to share this.",

Recommendations for protein targets are based on studies in people with a varied diet to begin with, so every single gram doesn't have to be complete to count.\n\nThere's also the idea of protein combining. For example, rice is deficient in lysine (88%), and chickpeas are deficient in methionine (87%), but both are a good deal above 100% in all the other essential amino acids.\n\nBut again, just vary your sources of protein a bit. They will make up for each other. Or you can just go a bit on the higher end of the recommended intake.\n\n1.6-2.2g protein/kg bodyweight is the standard recommendation for people who work out. Below that you can still make some progress, but the results will likely be diminished.\n\nYou will almost invariably gain some fat when bulking.

When you have some experience, learned more about your body and how it reacts to the training, learned what type of training you enjoy and can stick to for an extended period of time.\n\nAnd to your point of pyramids: you can work up (increasing the weight) or work down (lowering the weight) or can do both legs (up and then down). It depends on what you want to achieve. (i.e. pyramids building up tax you a bit more before your heaviest sets, so it won't be as effective for pure strength gains as when you hit your top set fresh - but this fatigue can also be useful to some goals).

Because if you look at most top athletes (and this goes for any field/profession actually), they have one thing in common - they've found an approach that works for them personally, based on their specific needs, which they've identified for themselves.\n\nWe're all unique, and while some approaches work for a general population - it's always beneficial to keep an open mind, because sometimes *(often times?)* the \"general approach\" isn't necessarily the best fit for you personally.\n\n> and people get SO upset over it\n\nMy theory is - the idea that different things work better or worse for different people doesn't sit well with the average individual. \n\nHumans are herd animals, and we instinctively (on a primitive level) know that we survive only in highly coordinated groups. Therefore if something doesn't quite fit into \"the norm\" - we intuitively reject it.\n\nBut that thing that doesn't quite fit is exactly what makes an individual stand out and achieve more (again referring to the example of top athletes doing their own specific thing/approach).\n\nSo yeah, I think it's the \"herd mentality\". Not only is it holding people back, it's also making them hold *other people* back (to ensure the integrity of the herd doesn't get compromised).\n\nAnyway, armchair philosophy/psychology rant over.",

There is no attachment or position or exercise that is definitively the best option for everyone. The truth is that so much **could** work, if you try hard, consistently, for a long time. I could give you a list of tricep isolations and compound movements that target them, some weekly volume and frequency recommendations and a way to progress over time. If you follow it, that would probably result in bigger triceps, the point is that there are a thousand different ways to fill in these variables and you would get good results all the same.

If you want a bigger bench, then go and bench and progress that work. And if you want you can throw in smith benches in addition to that. If you structure it well, it will help out your bench press - just as any other variation and assistance exercise would (wide grip bench, close grip bench, db bench, chest flies, skull crushers,...).

        "content": "I\u2019m looking for thoughts and opinions. \n\nBackground: I\u2019ve been training at this gym regularly for over a year now. I\u2019ve really enjoyed this gym but there has been some annoying issues. Examples of these annoying issues are: no soap in the bathroom for a day or two at a time-a few times per month, occasionally no toilet paper, occasionally now wipes for equipment, the scale in the locker room had a dead 9V battery for an entire month. These issues happen during the week when the staff member is on site, not during the weekends on unstaffed days. The one staff member on site sits back in the office instead of at the front desk, which leads to people coming in to sign up and having to bother people working out for help. \n\nWhat happened: Friday I was doing overhead tricep extensions with just over half the stack (25kg/55lbs) when the cable snapped on me. Being in an appropriate stance saved me from serious injury when I inevitably went flying forward. I was pissed. I chose to not go knock on the office door to see if the staff member was present because I was pissed off and didn\u2019t want to yell at the guy. I finished my workout and thought I\u2019d take time to process everything before I speak with him Monday morning. \n\nToday (Saturday), I am at the gym again and go to the other functional trainer for some lat pullovers. I set the weight and inspect the cable. The photos show the awful condition of the cable. \n\n\nWhat would you do? Would you give the guy a hard time for not doing his job? Would you post a review with photos? Would you go to a new gym? \n\n\nTLDR: Been at the same gym for over a year. Friday the cable on a functional trainer snapped on me. Today the other one has a cable looking like the photos. The one staff member on site sits in the back doing fuck all, neglects to maintain the gym, bathrooms, etc. ",

                "comment": "There is no excuse for the condition of those cables. None. The cables on the CMDAP (code name of that machine) are thinner than those on other cable machines because they need to be more flexible for the different exercises you can do. However, they are still extremely strong and durable. A cable like cannot deteriorate quickly\u2014it\u2019s hard to even cut those cable with bolt cutters. \n\nThe damage you see is the results of months or years of neglect. \n\nWhat to do? It\u2019s up to you. The gym is exposing itself to substantial liability by letting machines get into that condition. If you like the gym otherwise, I would not talk to the desk person, but try to find who actually owns the gym and contact them with your pictures. Those machines should be taken out of service immediately. \n\nYou could also choose to go somewhere else. If that gym is that lax about equipment maintenance, who knows what other safety issues exist? If you decide to leave, then it\u2019s a matter of your sense of obligation to the public. You can choose to just leave and not get involved, or leave and make some waves (letters, complaints, bad reviews). \n\nI would take action, but my situation is a little different in that I worked in the fitness industry for over 35 years, and have a lot of experience with equipment maintenance. So I would be all over them, just on general principles, including making a sign and shutting down the machine myself ;-)",

If you can't run, you can walk the same distance and burn similar calories.\n\nDiet has only really locked in within the last 2 months:\n\n30g of oats for breakfast with lots of fruit (prunes are insane in oats), with 30g of protein powder added. \n\nMeal prepped lunch and dinner. With one of the meals having fried veg instead of rice or pasta. Both meals have a good portion of meat, I aim to have salmon twice a week, but I primarily eat beef and chicken (sometimes turkey).\n\nCalories by month went like this:\n\n2300, 2100,1900,1800,1800.\n\n\nJust do whatever exercises that feel good to you, so long as you push yourself, then that's good.",

Mushrooms and red onion with sweetcorn is a good choice. Switched to low calorie desserts like 330cal ice cream from Aldi. I don't bake much anymore but I did make some nice matcha brownies.",

Arnold was a lot more cunning and a better businessman than the rest of them. The reason why I wouldn't put Arnold on top is because I don't think he is a decent human being or at least he wasn't at that time.\n\nThe most aesthetic bodybuilder is Bob Paris.

Mainly that I've been working on my brace first and foremost with the intention of adding in a belt soon to push for 250kg and beyond.\n\n\" In case you're wondering about belts:\n\n1. Wearing a belt improves your performance in the gym\n2. These performance increases likely mean increased size and strength in the long run\n3. There are still instances that it\u2019s better to train beltless, but you should probably use a belt for the bulk of your training\n\n[https://www.strongerbyscience.com/the-belt-bible/](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/the-belt-bible/)\n\nThere's no hard and fast standard as to when or if you should start using a belt. If you've become familiar with the basic lifts, and have been paying attention to your technique and\u00a0[bracing](https://barbend.com/bracing-cues-heavy-lifts/), you may want to consider one. Wearing a belt doesn't help if you don't already brace effectively. \"",

Unfortunately, apart from weightlifting shoes, there are barely any shoes that fulfil these. Not everyone wants to invest in a separate shoe for weightlifting. So barefoot is the best. Honestly better than any shoes. I go barefoot whenever I need to perform a movement where I need to push the ground hard. If you don\u2019t plan to compete, barefoot is the best.\nFor the belt part, honestly if without belt you don\u2019t know how to brace your core, having a belt on won\u2019t magically support your lift and protect you from injury. I am not a professional, the max I have lifted 130kg for 3 reps with a body weight of 67kg. It is challenging, but having mastered how to brace my core in a 360 degree fashion (breathing in my stomach rather than chest) I never used belt.\n\nCheck out squat university for these tips.",

Are you getting enough protein? Are you gaining weight? Are you following a proper program with a built in progression system? \n\nAs for improvements in your technique - the point of contact with the bench should be your upper traps. Use your legs to push your body into this position and keep that pressure on them. Bring the chest to the bar as you bring the bar down to keep the arch stable and shoulder blades retracted. Bar path on the ascent should be back towards the face as it goes up, its probably easier to search 'bar path bench'. Keep your wrist stacked over your forearms, currently your bending them back more as you lift. \n\nAny technique improvements may increase your bench slightly, but they will not fix the issue you have of not getting stronger.",

You want around 150g or a little under\n\n\n>if by program u mean like set exercises no i dont.\n\nIt's important to follow a structured program, which will tell you when to progress and manage fatigue. If you look at the fitness wiki there are some recommended programs under the beginner section you may like to try. Gzclp is a fun one. \n\n\n>Thank you for the advice/guidance i actually ended up having a bit of wrist pain at the end of the day did not think that it could have been linked to this.\n\nTo help keep your wrist straight first put the bar across the meaty part of your palm, then close your fingers.

This will provide stability during the lift\n\n- That being said, when unracking the weight, don\u2019t stretch your arms out all the way, as this undoes the driving of your shoulders into the bench. Just take the bar off the hook and start going down\n\n- Put your feet firmly into the ground as to stabilize the rest of your body. Start with your head off the bench, put your knees in a 90 deg angle (give or take), pull your chest to the bar (like an inverted row) and them position yourself with your eyes just behind the bar, taking pointer 1 into account still. You will have the little arch in your lower back. This will create tension on your body, will stabilize it and will allow you to use leg drive. \n\nOther than that, keep at it!",

My only suggestion would be to pay attention to your upper back. It may sound odd to worry about your back when doing a chest exercise, but it can make a huge difference by providing a solid platform for the bench press. You may be doing that already but you seem a tiny bit unsteady during the movement. When you get the bar above your chest (or even before), pull your shoulder blades together and down, and keep them there. I started doing that a couple of years ago and it made a big difference. After a heavy bench session my back aches more than my chest. Julius Maddox has a 795lb bench and I've heard him say he trains his back more than his chest.",

The Olympic technique is generally weaker so if you wanted to change your technique I\u2019d suggest instead of dropping you hips then initiating the lift, start the lift (slack pull) then drop your hips into position and I bet you could pull more that way.\n\nJust read the rest of ur post and if u wanna train more for clean and snatch then this is a perfect deadlift.\n\nWhy y\u2019all downvoting him \ud83d\ude2d so mean",

It is a very, if not the most, taxing lift\n\nI can't express enough how important and crucial periodization and recovery are important in deadlift\n\nAnother thing you could try is focusing on parts of the movement for the sake of enhancing strength in certain positions while diminishing the risk of injury and the fatigue level, so you can in the end put it all together in the complete deadlift\n\nAnyway, congrats on your numbers and movement. Good luck with it, and keep us updated. It would be cool to see your progression",

Since your main focus is on improving your oly lifts, sets of 5+ touch and go reps don't make the most sense. I would focus on performing sets of 1-3 reps, taking each rep from a dead stop on the floor. Since it sounds like hypertrophy is not a priority and recovery is an issue, controlling the eccentric to the degree that you are in this vid is counter-productive. Presumably you're working out somewhere that dropping weights isn't frowned on, so drop that weight, save your juice. \n\nNow, if you just wanted to build a huge deadlift, I would tell you to do everything above + a whole lot of posterior chain hypertrophy work + eat like a bear in fat bear season. I don't think that advice aligns well with your other goals, though.",

I have no idea what my 1RM is for either, but I OHP the same amount as I flat bench, yet I can incline bench more than either of those separately. I usually train compound lifts in the 5\u00d75 range but sometimes will do 3\u00d78-12 depending on my goals and program at the time.\n\nI know that's weird. Most people seem to be able to do more with flat bench, then as they more vertical can press less and less.\n\nHowever I've noticed a big factor in how much I OHP is (obviously) how stable I am at the start of the lift. For instance, there are some racks that when I rerack, vecause of the angle or height, I just can't seem to get my arms and shoulders in the right position and I end up feeling the OHP way more in tris than shoulders. I never feel it in my pecs, which is good because my goal is mostly to hit shoulders with OHP.\n\nI can OHP at least 225 for reps, but can't even bench 315 for as many reps.",

It is hard to do the raw clean before every set, because i just can't do barbell clean and i have never learned it. Might be because i do not do it very often and my wrist mobility is not very good :D And it also is quite hard to learn the correct technique. Well my best bench is 275 pounds for 1RM, not paused, but my ass didn't get up from the bench and i didn't bounce it and it was a controlled lift. (125kg). And now i ovh pressed 160 pounds (73kg) for 3 sets of 4 reps but the issue for me is performing the clean before being able to press the barbell so sometimes i get the barbell to a good position where it is easier to press from and sometimes i don't. And that makes a huge difference when it comes pressing heavy weights. It is not because i lack the power to clean 73kg, i have cleaned 200 pounds with that same technique. The issue is where the barbell lands after i have performed the clean. because i just mainly use momentum, back muscles and biceps and forearms for my cleans. So i am going to go to the gym and test my true 1RM from a rack. So i don't need to worry about the clean movement :D Sorry if i am repeating the same sentences again and again btw. But what i do know is that i cannot overhead press my bodyweight for sure. I weight exactly 200 pounds myself. But i might  start to work towards it because it sounds cool and i also think is quite impressive. My OVH press pr from the rack position is 3 sets of 6 reps with 155 pounds (exactly 70kg). So it might even be a realistic goal in the future! Thank you for your worlds.",

That can really improve the form and the power output is greater!!.\n\nCheers mate!

Also, you can train stability by doing super slow reps.\n\n2) your setup is a bit loose; check out Alan Thrall\u2019s deadlift guide for a great step-by-step on form.",

I got back up to around 245 again and now I\u2019m trending at about 215. Seeing old pictures helps, but this time around I am determined to stop thinking about it so much and just enjoy the journey! I think my goal is 200 but again, I try not to get so hung up on the numbers and enjoy the journey. \n\nEating right/ counting calories and macros and trying new things in the gym (and old favorites). \n\nYou have great progress and cutting 80 pounds is no joke my friend.

Then I got a personal trainer, upped my calories, improved my training routine and put on quite a lot of muscle, almost as newbie gains in \\~6 months constantly increasing the weights in pretty much all exercises. I'm now around 85kg (\\~188lbs), I may not have lost much fat ever since but I look far fitter due to the muscle gain. \n\nNot telling you to up calories and lift heavy now, but if you hit a plateau for 3-4 months despite doing all things right, I totally encourage you to ponder getting help from a professional to review your diet and training routine if you want to keep on grinding once plateaud.",

It\u2019s very easy there is a number of ways if you search it up. Then download some sort or macro tracking app, I use an app called MacrosFirst. Try to consistently eat and track the proper number of calories each day, while eating a good number of protein for your body. I would recommend weight training also to gain some muscle because it makes the whole process easier. Also drink plenty of water. All this is really all you need to know. I would recommend watching fitness related content for a better understanding, also for motivation. \nI\u2019m not where I want to be yet, but I\u2019m happy to help others. \nGood luck!",

Stretch marks are still there and I think they\u2019re here to stay. But the skin can readjust to your new body shape with time, you just gotta maintain. \n\nIt is to be noted though in 23 now, so age almost definitely helped. Also you need to focus on having enough protein to support collagen production. Don\u2019t take collagen supplements unless your healthcare provider says you need it. Enough protein gets you there better than the supplementation. Also try to resistance train. It helps A LOT.",

I'm sure you've had a couple (weight) thresholds that seemed impossible to progress from (For me they were 96kg and then 83kg) but you end(ed) up succeeding. In the end it is easier to lose one kg when that's 0.8% of your total weight than when it is 1.25% and your fat percentage has decreased. \n\nFor me the measure was also feels and fitness progress. When I was stuck in those two thresholds, I was looking at other factors: Am I lifting heavier in the gym? Am I faster or can I swim for longer time in the pool? And since there was improvement there, I kept calm and doing my thing. It was when I was neither progressing in my fitness nor my weight that I got professional help, but well, tbh, I would had done it before had I known how good it turned out for me.\n\nAlso, perhaps this would be my second biggest regret that I did not do: Taking measurements. Chest, waist, biceps, thighs, calves. Looking back, I believe that back then I might had seen progress with any of these measurements despite the weight staying the same for a while.",

I see some stretch marks, which could indicate loose skin, but they aren\u2019t too crazy; there\u2019s a good chance he can continue to cut and get rid of it.

I have never used straps or double overhand grip but i have done heavy dumbell rows without straps so i just gotta work the double overhand deadlift. I will post my progress here! I hope i will get to a 405 double overhand. I have small hands and depending on the barbell, some barbells are a little easier to pull and some a little harder. But yeah my 1rm is 210kg, and yesterday i did a little lighter workout with mixed grip (4 sets of 3 reps with 171kg) I have always been wanting to deadlift a lot but i have just always focused on something else for 6 months like ovh press and heavy dumbell rows for example. Deadlift is by far my worst lift at the moment because i just do not train it too often but now i have found that deadlifting is fun when i made my own home gym.",

Play around with seat height and grip width until you find what is most comfortable. \n\nFew key pointers / things that I see:\n\n1. Grip is a bit too narrow, ideally you want to have your fore arms roughly perpendicular to your torso throughout the movement. \n\n2. Adjust the seat height so that at the start of the movement, your hands are in line with your nipples. \n\n3. Control the movement on the way back down. You're letting it fall back to the starting position. \n\nExtra: You can try to find yoga blocks or some sort of pad to put on the seat, which will give you a better stretch at the bottom of the movement. \n\nHappy lifting!",

For the first 6 months I was in just a straight 300-400 a day calorie surplus. I got a good idea of my maintenance calories because I dieted for 4 months and lost 20lbs before I decided to start weightlifting. I wish I had that before pic haha. Pic 1 is post 20lb weight lost. This is my 12 month weight lifting progress. After 6 months of bulking then I did a mini cut for about 4 weeks at 1,000 calorie diet deficit and also did extra cardio because it did feel like I gained some fat but I kept it short because I didn\u2019t want to lose lean mass. I felt like shit during this time and would not go that extreme again even for a short period of time. Since then my diet has been really nice and easily manageable. I have been in a slight weekly deficit. 6 days of the week I am in roughly 100 calorie surplus, since only about 60 can even go to muscle per day anyways, and 1 day a week I am in a 1400 calorie deficit. For an 800 overall deficit for the week. This should make me roughly lose 12lbs over the course of 12 months. My bro science thought has been that I could build muscle still while being in a tiny overall deficit if I was technically bulking for 6 days of the week. I\u2019ve seen Dr. Mike from renaissance periodization talk about many variations of these types of body recomps and he says they really work and he\u2019s been very reliable for me so far. I would say though that I look a little leaner in picture 2 mostly because I fixed my pelvic tilt from daily stretching. There are 2 types of tilts and many people have 1 of the 2. Once I fixed my tilt, it made my core look noticeably better and made my lower back down to my hamstrings also feel much better as well. Also what I thought was sciatica seems to be gone now as well.",

Jeff Nippard has a video on this I believe. \n\nI can\u2019t really see from the video but it seems like you\u2019re already doing that a bit which is good! \nA 45 degree Elbow angle for lower weights can be good too as it decreases chance of injury and helps to build strength unless you\u2019re going really heavy in which case your elbows start to turn out a bit which can\u2019t really be helped. Optimal grip width is something you could check too which I think it\u2019s just outside shoulder width! \n\nI can\u2019t really fault you though you have good leg drive, arch, feet position and eccentric tension.

If you don't have much experience, try some already created ones.\n\n\n\u25cf K.I.S.S. - you generally do not need to hit every possible variation of every possible lift.

As long as you know your basics. Big barbell movements, brining up basic weak points... The specifics aren't that important.\n\nI'm analysis-paralasys personified. My best success comes from just putting my fucking head down, getting off the forums, and finishing a program from start to finish. 531? Worked for me. Jeff Nippard? Worked for me. Brian Alsruhe? Guess what... Worked for me. In every event I saw notable improvement and success.\n\nThe only time I failed was when bouncing programs and missing days.\n\nFeel great? Get after it. 3 hours of sleep? Get after it. 12 hour day at work? Don't care, get your ass in there and do what you can.",

You're better off focusing on some parts and leave minimal volume to others. Obv you can swap to avoid imbalances.  \n  \n  \n2) you should stick to exercises you feel more. I don't care some of them are a must, I'd 100% times pick the equivalent that give me a better feedback. It doesn't mean I won't enjoy new stuff in the future. Like, usually some changes occur naturally. There are some stuff you just need to approach after some time and it varies from person to person.  \n  \n  \n3) dieting is important but you don't really need that much protein. Listen to your body. If you're stronger and more energetic with, let's say 1.5g of protein per kg just stick to it. It doesn't make much sense to imitate a pro if you don't know why exactly they're doing the things they do.",

People can show up to the gym diligently and accomplish fuckall. I've seen several of my friends do it. Heck I was stalled for about 2 years even though I never missed a workout.     \n  \nConsistency being number 1? Yeah I can get behind that. Add in diet and programming in the 2/3 slots and you've got yourself a pretty solid top 3.  \n  \nI'm probably being too pedantic here, so you can just ignore me lol",

I'm being dramatic. It's just for some reason the people at large have an easier time counting calories and getting on a program, but not just putting in a bit of work. (Crazy to me, because I'm the exact opposite. Gimme something heavy and/or hard and I'm into it, but actually tracking things is so incredibly uninteresting to me, which will be my downfall)",
