Hell you can train the same muscle group every day as long as the volume and load management is done appropriately \n\nWhen I started benching at moderate intensity 4-5x a week with variations to intensity and load management to get my bench better for competitive powerlifting, it skyrocketed my shit way more than training hard as fuck 1-2x a week and using multiple days in between to recover",

            "comment": "\"Training until involuntary slowdown\" is probably the biggest thing.  Basically you perform reps at full power on the concentric until you can't move the weight as fast as you could the previous reps.  It turns how that once you start slowing down, you're essentially at an RIR of about 3-4.  So it became a great way to gauge how close to failure I am during a set.  \n\nThe other is 2 second controlled eccentric in to full stretch on the muscle.  Basically never let gravity take control of the weight when resetting.",

            "comment": "These are a few that I use that I find helpful. \n\nTraining opposing muscle groups. So If I'm working my glutes, I'm also training hip flexors. Or if I'm working my chest I also work my back. Pull-ups and dips back to back baby!\n\nFocusing primarily on my core. Unlike every other muscle group, the core can handle nearly 6 days of training a week, so I give it as much attention in as many novel ways as possible.\n\nBeing more concerned about form and being able to pause during sets than worrying about how heavy the weight is. I don't fall into the camp of chasing huge numbers. I can lift heavier than your average 34-year-old in most major lifts, so I am way more concerned with form and having control through the entire move.\n\nI train for longevity. Fitness for most people is a race against yourself, and I have plenty of years ahead of me. So there is no reason to go crazy or do anything too wild. \n\nBuilding novelty into every workout. I am currently using a 3-month plan I developed which trains for an hour twice a week. Day one is glutes, hip flexors, chest, and back. Day two is delts, lats, quads, and hamstrings. Then both have a ton of core work mixed in. Each workout has its own unique design so I don't get bored and I am just slowly cycling through different skills. It's a blast.",

It is an area that I had been neglecting for years and kind of accepted that I am just not a very flexible person. However, at a certain point I thought it was ridiculous that I couldn't even touch touch my toes without bending my knees. \n\nI now incorporate dynamic stretching before every workout and do specific exercises for flexibility (especially targeting my hips and hip flexors). It allows me to get a better ROM during my lifts and supposedly protects form injury (I can't say for sure if it has decreased my injury risk but I certainly feel a lot less stiff now). It's also great for stress relief and is a nice change from the usual high intensity workouts.",

Going for a 5-10km ruck(walking with extra weight, like a rucksack, backpack, or I use a weight vest)is wonderful. It burns a decent amount of calories, and depending on the weight, can really build your cardio and lower body and core strength.",

Don\u2019t be super stringent about time based programs, if it says 12 weeks then don\u2019t just flip it around or drop it after 12, if you feel like you can keep going then do so, conversely if you plateau somewhere then first order of business should be to switch it up for the closest variation( eg switch incline dumbell for incline barbell). This is advice geared towards slightly more advanced people \n\n3. There\u2019s days I wake up feeling like crap(like today) where I feel like I couldn\u2019t move the empty bar if I tried my best, I still went though, and lo and behold I did just fine and even made progress. Entering the gym alone gives me what it takes to do my best. I never decide whether or not I should take today off when I\u2019m at home(unless it\u2019s a scheduled day off ofc)",
