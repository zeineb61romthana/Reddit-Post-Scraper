        "content": " As a personal trainer, I wanted to take the time to answer some of the most frequently asked questions by people who are new to working out. Feel free to let me know if I've missed anything!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### How do I lose weight?\n\nIt\u2019s actually way simpler than you might think: maintain a caloric deficit. Consume fewer calories than you burn. It doesn\u2019t matter of you\u2019re morbidly obese or you\u2019re cutting for a show, this basic principal still applies. Note that eating a healthy diet makes this **far** easier - lots of fruits, veggies, lean protein and water will help you stay satiated for far fewer calories than fatty junk foods (not to mention you\u2019ll have way more energy, and just feel better).\n\nTo find out how many calories you should be eating in a day to lose weight, you have a few different options. The first is to determine your maintenance calories with an online calculator, then subtract 250-500 per day from that (to lose about 0.5-1lbs per week). \n\nThe other option (my personal favourite, because everyone is different!) is to start by just honestly tallying up how much you\u2019re currently eating each day. Once that\u2019s determined, start by subtracting 250-500 calories per day. If you haven\u2019t lost any weight in a couple weeks, subtract that amount again, until you start seeing progress.\n\nThere\u2019s tons of food tracking apps out there, but I recommend [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) \\- it\u2019s free, easy to use, you can scan food labels, and the food database included is enormous.\n\nAnother important note - increasing the amount of calories you burn per day (ie. exercising) will also help you stay in a caloric deficit. However, it\u2019s best NOT to rely solely on this method. Doing a whole hour of cardio will only burn a few hundred calories (plus will likely make you hungry for snacks by the time you\u2019re finished) \u2026 or, you can simply avoid eating a bag of chips or a piece of pizza, to have the exact same effect. \n\nThat\u2019s not to imply that exercise isn\u2019t important in your weight loss journey - quite the contrary! However, instead of focusing on doing hours of cardio a day, this should only be used to supplement your diet (1-2 hours a week is fine for most people). Your focus should instead be on resistance training. Lifting heavy weights 2-4 times per week plays the important role of ensuring you **maintain your muscle mass as you lose weight.** Want to avoid that \u201cskinny fat\u201d look, and get \u201ctoned\u201d instead? Make sure you\u2019re doing resistance training! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n### How do I lose weight in ___ area?\n\nUnfortunately, spot reduction is a myth. Where you lose weight first (and last) is determined by genetics. However, you \\*will\\* eventually lose weight in all your problem areas. You just need to be patient, and keep doing what helped you start losing weight in the first place.\n\n The good news is, the more weight you lose, the more visible the progress will be (especially if you\u2019re doing a good job focusing on just fat loss, while retaining muscle). Going from 250-240lbs probably won\u2019t be noticeable, but losing those last 10lbs will make a huge difference (since a few pounds will make up a far greater percentage of your total body mass). So the progress will be hard-fought for, but definitely worth it! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n### How do I gain muscle?\n\nIt\u2019s a combination of progressively harder resistance training, eating enough food, and lots of patience.\n\nWhen you\u2019re exercising, just going through the motions isn\u2019t good enough. For optimal muscle gain, you should be performing each set with a weight that you can lift continuously for around 30-60s (this should amount to around 8-15 repetitions). If you feel like you can go for longer, choose a heavier weight. \n\nPerform each repetition slowly (about 1 second concentric, pause, 2-3 seconds eccentric, pause), through a full range of motion. To clarify - the concentric portion of a lift is when you\u2019re moving against gravity, and the eccentric portion is when you\u2019re moving with gravity. Exercises involving long static holds (like planks) are great for endurance, but they won\u2019t amount to much muscle mass gained.\n\nI cannot overemphasize how important good form is either - for avoiding injury, hardwiring the correct neural pathways, and maximizing muscle gain. Especially when you\u2019re just starting out, choose light weights, and make sure optimal form comes naturally before you start increasing the intensity. It\u2019s way easier learning it correctly the first time than fixing bad habits later.\n\nHow much food should you be eating? It varies widely between people. Start with your maintenance calories, add a couple hundred to that (it doesn\u2019t have to be a lot!), and measure your results. Be patient with your progress - men can expect to gain 1-2lbs of lean muscle a month, and 0.5-1lbs for women (beginners may gain a little faster). Eating enough protein is also vital to gaining muscle - a general rule of thumb is around 1 gram of protein (each day) per pound of lean body weight (ie. how much you weigh, minus the amount of fat you have). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n### How do I get stronger?\n\nIt honestly depends on your experience level. If you\u2019re just starting out, doing a normal resistance routine focused on gaining muscle will make you stronger. However, if you\u2019ve been working out regularly for awhile (close to a year), using heavier weights (1-6 reps max) will help you get stronger a lot faster. \n\nIf you\u2019re focusing more purely on strength gain, it\u2019s important that each repetition is done as perfectly as possible (even moreso than for other training goals). That means stopping 1-2 reps shy of failure. Doing just one sloppy rep can severely impact your strength output for the rest of the workout. Don\u2019t be afraid of taking longer rests between sets either (up to 2-3 minutes), as you want to be ready with as much energy as possible before you start your next set. It also goes without saying that heavier weight = greater chance for injury, and proper form will help prevent that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Is it possible to lose fat and build muscle at the same time?\n\nContrary to popular belief - yes. Especially if you\u2019re a beginner! Just make sure you\u2019re eating around maintenance level calories (along with enough protein), doing resistance training 3-4 times a week, and you\u2019ll start seeing body composition changes. \n\nHowever, if you\u2019re significantly over/underweight, or have already been working out for some time, you\u2019ll see much faster progress if you focus on one goal at a time. The main difference here is going to be diet - eating less if you\u2019re trying to lose weight, or eating more if you\u2019re trying to gain weight. Regular resistance training plays a part in both shedding fat and gaining muscle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### How should I be structuring my workouts?\n\nFor the vast majority of people, full body workouts with compound exercises is the way to go. (For those who don\u2019t know, compound exercises are those which use more than one joint at a time - think squats, bench press, rows, etc.)\n\nThe popular back/chest/shoulders/arms/legs split routine (or any variation of it) is good for advanced bodybuilders, but not ideal for beginners. Bodybuilders exercise like this because they need a much greater stimulus to properly stress any given muscle group, and more rest between days training that muscle group as a result of their increased workout intensity.\n\nFor a beginner, it\u2019s better to hit each muscle group multiple times a week (this is great to hasten learning and growth). You won\u2019t need as long of a rest period before training the same muscle again, because it won\u2019t be as fatigued after each workout.\n\nCompound exercises give you the greatest bang for your buck because you\u2019re working out so many muscles in one movement (and burning way more calories at the same time). Isolation exercises (those working one joint at a time, like bicep curls or leg extensions) are best for bodybuilders who really need to hone in on a single muscle.\n\nDoing resistance training 3-4 times a week is a good goal to shoot for. Workouts should be around 45-60 minutes, with around 6-8 exercises done during that time. Try to keep rests between sets to around 60s (this is all very generalized, and can change depending on experience level and goal). Space rest days evenly between workouts if you can.\n\nStart your workouts with the exercises which require the most energy (usually those which involve lifting the most weight), saving any isolation/ab exercises for the end.\n\nIf you\u2019d like some help planning your workout routine, I just released a fitness app called [PerfectFit](https://www.perfect-fit.app/). It gives you access to workouts designed by a personal trainer, all customized according to your unique goals, fitness level, and available equipment. There are tons of bodyweight exercises included - ideal for anyone working out at home! The app is currently available to download on Android, and iOS is hopefully just a few days away (currently under review).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### What should I be eating?\n\nIf your goal is a change in body composition (gaining muscle/losing fat), the amount of calories you\u2019re consuming is the most important thing to pay attention to.\n\nIf you\u2019re consistently working out hard but failing to gain/lose weight, chances are you need to make alterations to your diet. For weight loss, that usually means eating at a deficit of 250-500 calories per day; for weight gain, eating at a surplus of 200-300 calories per day.\n\nWhat exact foods you\u2019re eating has an impact on how easily you can stick to your calorie goals, as well as your energy levels.\n\nConsuming around 1 gram of protein per pound of lean bodyweight (per day) is a given, regardless of what your fitness goal is. This helps to maintain satiety, and preserve/increase muscle mass.\n\nEating lots of fruits and veggies (as well as drinking 2-3L of water a day - more for some people) is a great way to feel full without consuming too many calories. It also just contributes to all-around health and energy levels.\n\nEating lots of fatty foods should be avoided if weight loss is the goal - not because fat makes you fat per se, but because they are so calorically dense. Only one tablespoon of peanut butter or olive oil is 100 calories! Conversely, if your goal is to **gain** weight, adding more fatty foods to your diet (healthy fats, if possible) can help you hit that calorie goal easier.\n\nAnd carbs? Not as evil as people make them out to be. Think of them as the energy that fuels your brain and your workouts. Having around 50% of your calories coming from carbs is about the norm. It\u2019s likely beneficial to raise this number even higher if you\u2019re an especially lean individual, or you\u2019re regularly working out at intense levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### When should I be eating?\n\nThe easiest way to time your meals properly is to think: \u201cWhat will I be doing in the next 2-3 hours?\u201d Eat according to the activity you\u2019re about to do. That doesn\u2019t mean you should be having a giant meal right before your workout, but ideally your biggest meal of the day would be several hours before you exercise. This will give you the energy you need, plus ensure the calories you consume are shuttled into your muscles instead of fat reserves.\n\nIf you\u2019re about to do an intense workout, the best thing to eat beforehand (around 15-30 minutes prior) is a light snack of healthy carbs (like some fruit). For optimal recovery, aim for 20-30g of protein within an hour after you workout (if you miss this window though don\u2019t worry about it). A protein shake is probably the simplest and most convenient way of doing this, but whole food is just as good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### What supplements should I be taking?\n\nIf you have a healthy, well-rounded diet, including 2-3 cups of different veggies each day,  enough protein per pound of bodyweight (from sources that include sufficient amounts of each essential amino acid), and adequate omega-3 fatty acids - then you\u2019re golden, and probably don\u2019t need any supplements.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of the population would probably benefit from a simple multivitamin and omega-3 supplement, just to help fill any nutritional gaps they have.\n\nIf you\u2019re getting enough protein from whole food, then you probably don\u2019t need to add protein powder. However, if you\u2019re struggling with this, then protein powder is a great way to easily increase your daily protein intake. Whey protein is the most bioavailable and has a complete amino acid profile, so it\u2019s the best choice for most people. However, if you\u2019re vegan (or lactose intolerant), there are lots of plant proteins available. You just need to pay attention to the amino acid profile of each one (possibly mixing and matching different plant sources if you need to).\n\nAs for all the other supplements out there, it\u2019s honestly on a case-by-case basis as to whether they\u2019d actually help you or not. If you\u2019re a beginner, unless you have any specific requirements or deficits, you probably don\u2019t need them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Is stretching important?\n\nYes. Please stretch (or do some other form of myofascial release, such as foam rolling), or you\u2019ll eventually regret it. Regular exercise makes your muscles slowly form clumps of tissue and fascia. Neglecting to release these can result in restricted range of motion, and eventually pain.\n\nStatic stretching should be done at the **end** of your workout. Aim to stretch each worked muscle near its end range of motion for around 60s total. Don\u2019t stretch before your workout, as this can impede strength output.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Is warming up important?\n\nYes. Warming up is paramount to increasing blood flow and activating your muscles properly before you move onto more intense, metabolically demanding exercises. \n\nIdeally, during your warm-up, you should be actively moving your muscles through the same ranges of motion you\u2019ll be doing for your workout. This can be as simple as doing the exact same movement, but with minimal weight - for example, doing a few sets of bodyweight squats before doing barbell squats.\n\nYou want your warm-ups to elevate your heart rate, but not be so intense that they start tiring you out and detract from your workout. Usually 5-10 minutes of light activity is enough.",

From what I read, I should train my body one by one. So it's somewhat like this\n\nDay 1: Hands\nDay 2: Chest \nDay 3: Abs\nDay 4: legs\nDay 5: Hands\nEtc\n\nSo that by the time I exercise certain body parts, it already gain enough rest. \n\nEnglish is not my first language. So if my understanding is wrong, please correct me! \n\nIt's been a months since I start working on my abs. I just want a flat abs, so I tough to work it out.\n\nSomehow it doesn't seems to work. I got soreness, yes. But it's always elsewhere, despite I work my abs\n\nSo after reading this, I notice it's a myth to just lose fat from one part of our body. So my whole months is just waste.",

Later I'll add a daily 40 minute bike ride. \n\nShould I be doing more than one set of push ups? Does waiting a minute and doing 2 more push ups count as another set or would it be a part of the first set? How many sets should I do in a day? What's the healing rate of muscle?",

I am also seeing a lot of program ads on my feed for handstands and inversions. Wondering if there is a good program that is legit I can sign up for?. What\u2019s the best thing to drink to stay hydrated?. I hear water is ok but you need more than just water. I am vegetarian I eat pretty healthy. Sometimes I cheat I usually give myself a rule be good during the week and the weekend I can cheat. I don\u2019t cheat much just love to have a yummy breakfast like waffles and such.

Don't ever do those stupid kip up bouncing bullshit you see all the time nowadays. \n\nOnce you master the proper technique then do as many as you can until failure. Have goals and do whatever you can to reach that pull-up goal. Currently I'm trying to get back to doing 20 dead hang perfect pull ups. I attempt it once per week and try to get one additional pull up per week. I do 4 sets of pull ups per week which include weighted pull ups and regular ones with different grips (wide, close, palms in). You should be doing everything but don't do them everyday. You need to rest several days, if not a week after a solid workout.",

        "title": "Do you need to Gain Weight, Lose Weight, or Maintain Weight? Look Here First!",
        "content": "The following post was originally contributed my /u/mjconns, who recently left the moderator team, and deleted the original post.\n  \nThis is a one-stop shop for all weight-related questions -- also known as cutting/bulking/recomp. Ideas, suggestions, guides, workouts, etc -- everything you'll need to answer 99% of questions! This is meant to be a community/collaborative effort, so please add in suggestions in the comments!\n\nTo be clear on a couple terms -- when exercising and eating to gain weight, that is called\u00a0__bulking__\u00a0(aka caloric \"surplus\"). Eating less to lose weight is called\u00a0__cutting__\u00a0(aka caloric \"deficit\"). And eating just enough to not gain or lose weight is called\u00a0__maintenance__\u00a0(aka recomposition or \"recomp\").\n\n## A visual guide to male and female BF% estimates\n\n-   [From athleanx](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8IPmtkFYQx/?igshid=17upb60h7gk3)\n\nI don't like guessing BF% as there's no way to know how much visceral fat we store internally. But athleanx's general guidelines are as good as any for visual estimates.\n\n## Who should cut or bulk?\n\nThe idea behind cut and bulk cycles is to gain muscle and fat in a bulk phase and then try to keep all your muscle and burn off fat in a cut phase. This approach is generally 'faster', when done correctly, than \"recomps\" (recompositions) where you maintain your weight but work out hard and try to replace fat with muscle.\n\nGenerally speaking, if you're an active person and/or consistently working out, you can do cut/bulk cycles. To get started, you need to know your\u00a0maintenance\u00a0calories (\"maint\") to have an idea on how many calories you can consume without gaining or losing weight, hence the term maintenance; no change in weight. To bulk, you eat more than maintenance (aka \"surplus\") and to cut you eat less than maintenance (aka \"deficit\"). If you\u00a0*are not*\u00a0working out and you bulk, that's how you get fat. So don't eat above maint if you're not also working out.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started, you need to know your \"maintenance\" calorie needs and for an estimate you need a TDEE calculator (I like\u00a0[this one](https://tdeecalculator.net/), but you can google for others). Think of this as a starting point to use that will need some adjusting over time.\n\nOnce you have an estimated maintenance, you generally add 250-500 calories for a bulk and subtract 250-750 calories in a cut. Generally, it's safer to over-do cuts and under-do bulks. In a bulk you gain both fat and muscle and after a point you only gain fat (fat stores faster than you can build new muscle), so be cautious in bulks and don't \"dirty\" bulk.\n\n## Deciding to cut or bulk\n\nSo far as I'm aware, there isn't a hard science behind\u00a0*when*\u00a0to bulk or cut, but there are guidelines to consider. When bulking, our bodies build muscle\u00a0*and*\u00a0store fat and, after a point, our bodies prioritize storing fat over building muscle. This is why dirty bulking is bad and, generally speaking, if your BF% is > 20%, you should not bulk. Any higher BF% and your body tends to prioritize fat storage vs muscle gained from bulking.\n\nSimilarly, cuts are usually done to around 10% because any lower than that and the body will begin to consume more muscle than fat and muscle loss is more likely.\n\nYou\u00a0*can*\u00a0make strength gains on a cut. You can't build new muscle, but you can \"refactor\" (that's my word for it, I'm sure there's a scientific one) existing muscle to be more efficient, hence stronger, as you lose fat. Also, repetitive gym visits will help you become more proficient at working out which helps in the long run when you start bulking and building new muscle.\n\nIf you're really unsure, you can make a post in\u00a0[r/BulkOrCut](https://www.reddit.com/r/BulkOrCut/)\u00a0to get community feedback on what it's you personally should do.\n\nIf you're skinnyfat, generally you can eat at a small maintenance (aka \"clean bulk\") and make great strength gains. If you have little muscle mass to cut to, you will just look tiny/thin -- especially if you're tall. So for most skinnyfat people, and I would clean bulk and diligently follow a legit lifting routine. Which brings me to...\n\n## Workout routines\n\nBefore getting into routines, I think it's worth mentioning first that\u00a0everyone should walk more. At least 5 times per week, 30 minutes per day:\n\n-   [Get ripped. Get walking.](https://www.t-nation.com/training/get-ripped-get-walking)\n\nCheck out\u00a0[The Beginner's Guide to Working Out](https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/ihz264/beginners_guide_to_working_out/)\n\nThe best workout routine is the one you can consistently follow. If you're new to the gym, just about anything will get you some results. To a point. If you want to be smart about it,\u00a0do not make up your own routine!\u00a0There are plenty of legit, tried-and-true, FREE\u00a0[recommended lifting routines](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/)\u00a0to choose from. I like these routines vs googling something random because these are routines many, many people in various subreddits are doing and have done in the past that can help answer any questions you might have. It's nice to have someone else that is doing or has done the program you're running to offer direct advice from their experience. But you can just google other routines if you want. Just make sure it has:\n\n-   1.  Progressive overload\n\n-   2) Structured days to not hit body parts more than 2x/week\n\nIf you're working out at home, check out\u00a0[this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/GovSchwarzenegger/comments/flz3es/stay_at_home_stay_fit/)\u00a0from Arnold Schwarzenegger with a detailed bodyweight home routine.\n\nAlso another great\u00a0[full body workout](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA3ajQZjUTx/)\u00a0for people at home with no equipment.\n\n## What to eat\n\nAt the end of the day, for 99% of people (various diseases, ailments, and conditions aside), all that matters are Calories In, Calories Out (CICO). This controls weight\u00a0gain\u00a0and\u00a0loss. Lifting heavy weights encourages\u00a0strength gains\u00a0or at least strength maintenance in both surplus/bulks and deficit/cuts. But to gain or lose lbs on a scale, the total calories consumed minus calories used and the resulting surplus/deficit are what matters. But how much of what you eat matters...\n\nThere's a lot of suggested science over what to eat, but there are generally sound rules of thumbs to follow which are easily broken down into \"Macros\" for tracking purposes:\n\n-   Proteins (1 gram = 4 calories)\n\n-   Carbs (1 gram = 4 calories)\n\n-   Fats (1 gram = 9 calories)\n\nCollectively, all the macros we consume = total consumption (Calories In). When cutting, it's easiest to cut down fats and carbs. But keep protein high. When bulking, generally you add carbs and/or fats. Protein should always be high; it's what helps build muscle directly.\n\nHowever,\u00a0*how we feel*\u00a0when consuming these calories and what we get out of other nutrients is important.\n\n#### Fats\n\nWe all need healthy fats to help regulate hormonal balances. This is usually room-temp fats (think extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, various nuts, avocados, etc); less important are the fats in meat and dairy products, for example. A general rule of thumb is to aim for at least\u00a030% x total calories\u00a0for your fats macro. This is the same for cutting or bulking, but when bulking you can increase if you want.\n\nE.g. if you're consuming 2000 calories daily, aim for 0.3x2000 (600) calories to be from fats.\n\n#### Carbs\n\nNext come carbs. Carbs are not evil. They're a tool. Our body prefers and relies on carbs to refuel energy stores. Simple, nutrient-dense carbs are preferred -- not complex or junk carbs. The reason for this is 1) satiation, how long we'll feel full, and 2) other nutrient content. When you can, get your carbs from fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. That will do far more for you than crackers, cereal, donuts, etc. Even though the carbs will be utilized equally, produce holds far more vitamins and minerals that have relevant health and recovery benefits that can't be overstated.\n\nGenerally, aim for\u00a025-45%\u00a0of your calories to be carbs (depending on cutting/bulking).\n\n#### Protein\n\nGenerally, you want to keep protein fairly high. Anywhere from\u00a0.75-1+ gram of protein per lbs of body weight.\u00a0This can come from any source, as our body will utilize them the same. But some sources are preferred, depending on whether you're cutting or bulking. Ideally, aim for now more than 40-50 grams per meal/protein shake and spread out the consumption through the day.\n\nThe remainder of your calories should be protein.\n\n#### Timing\n\nAs carbs are for energy, many people prefer to have more carbs timed around workouts (and no fats during this period) to help boost performance and recovery. If you're going to eat your carbs (e.g. rice and chicken breast), do so about two hours before working out; otherwise, liquid/quickly consumed carbs are preferred (e.g. orange or apple juice). Again, post-workout, get simple carbs and protein into your system via a shake or meal fairly soon. Save fats for well-before or after workouts.\n\n##Measuring success\n\nFirst and foremost, gym progress should always be factored in first. If your routine says X lift should go up Y amount each week, generally you want to be hitting that to know you're on track. If your lift #s are going up according to your routine, you're doing great! If you aren't, there's a breakdown somewhere and you should ask for guidance if you cannot asses the fail point yourself.\n\nSecondly, the weight scale. You want to make sure your body weight is trending in your goal direction. It's ideal to weigh yourself\u00a0*the same way*\u00a0every time.\n\nFor example, I wake up, go to the bathroom, and then weigh myself every day for three weeks and then I average my daily changes over those three weeks. I generally aim to gain .5-.75 lbs per week and lose .75-1 lbs per week. If I'm gaining or losing too much, I adjust my macros ~ 250 calories and measure again for three weeks and so on.\n\nDon't get caught up daily changes; I sometimes vary 3-5 lbs between days! Weigh daily for three weeks and average it out. Don't worry about the daily weight, find an average to determine where the trend is taking you and adjust if needed. This will take the annoying variances out of the picture and let you focus on meaningful change.\n\nYou can also measure your wrists, waist, neck, etc, as well as take photos, but that's more preference and not as commonly suggested.\n\n##Bulking and cutting strategies\n\nI've seen people make amazing progress, both gaining and losing weight, in a variety of ways. Ideally, be healthy. Emphasize fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. But, at the end of the day,\u00a0many approaches work. You can bulk or cut as a vegan, intermittent fasting (\"IF\"), KETO, IIFYM, etc. Many approaches work. They are but tools available to you, so find one that best helps you meet your goal. So choose the best \"diet\" or tool that helps you achieve a goal! If that's keto, great! If that's caveman, awesome. I don't care! Limit your calories in whatever \"diet\" you choose and you'll see results.\n\nIn my opinion, it's better to make\u00a0*lifestyle*\u00a0changes that to follow a diet for a short time. So I don't really like \"diets\" per se, but more so recommend eating like an adult and limiting calories. But even still, different tactics can help in that goal, and you can deploy as many or as few as you want:\n\n-   Intermittent Fasting (\"IF\")\n\n-   Tracking macros / IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros)\n\n-   \"Banking\" calories\n\nI don't buy into the other 'benefits' of\u00a0IF, but it was a tactic that worked for me. I am a volume eater. I generally eat well, but I like eating\u00a0*a lot*. So when I'm cutting, my meals were small and sad. The idea behind IF is that you have a short window of time which you eat meals, the rest of the day you fast. Again, all that matters are calories. You can absolutely get fat eating 10k calories in a 5 hour window. So there's no magic in doing this. But for me, doing IF allowed me to have larger, more satiating meals within the \"eating window\" instead of more, smaller meals.\n\nMacros\u00a0are discussed above, but the idea behind IIFYM is that you've a set # for each macro and, so long as what you're eating fits neatly into the prescribed macro allotment, go for eating whatever you want! And, again, so long as total calories are low enough for you, you will lose weight. But this is\u00a0[r/BulkorCut](https://www.reddit.com/r/BulkorCut/), not\u00a0[r/weightloss](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightloss/). People here are also working out.\u00a0How well you workout, recover, perform, feel, etc\u00a0is affected by what you eat. So, sure, add in \"fun\" foods sometimes. But don't eat like a child simply because it fit your macros. A safe rule of thumb is to eat \"cleanly\" 80% of the time when bulking, whatever the other 20% of the time. When cutting, I try to eat cleanly 90-95% of the time with fewer treats. What that treat is might change -- some weeks I just want pancakes, other weeks I just want a couple beers. Do what works for you, just do so in controlled quantities.\n\nI liked\u00a0\"banking\" calories\u00a0when I knew I had a special event, date night with the wife, party, or whatever where I'd be consuming extra calories. One way to account for that is to deduct an\u00a0*additional*\u00a0amount of calories each day leading up to the event, to then splurge on that event. Example:\n\nLet's say my maintenance is 2,500 calories and I'm eating at a -500 deficit, so I'm eating 2,000 calories daily. I want to take my wife out for our anniversary, so the week leading up to our date night I deduct an additional -250 calories each day and only eat 1,750 calories daily. This gives me 7x250 (=1750) \"banked\" calories I can add to my 2,000 calories on our anniversary. Now I can have a nice dinner, dessert, a drink or two, all without blowing my diet out of whack!\n\n##Body fat % (BF%) estimates\n\nEstimating ones body fat % is kind of hard. We can't see how much fat is stored internally around organs; some people store more fat over the abs, some more around their love handles (that's me!), and others in their legs/ass. So it's really hard to tell. There are various ways to scan BF%, but most are imprecise with a +/- 20% variance. In my opinion, the only thing they're useful for is estimating BF%\u00a0*changes*. Let's say it reads 20% for you; in six months, you try again and it says 15%. You probably lost around 5% BF%, but your actual BF% might be 12%-18%. So it's not a particularly accurate reading, but the rate change is a useful gauge.\n\nThe best ways to learn BF% are via:\n\n-   Underwater Weighing (Hydrostatic Weighing) (1-2% variance)\n\n-   DEXA scan (1-2% variance)\n\nEverything else has huge variance and is only useful for measuring rate of change.\n\n##Differences in males and females\n\n-   Basically,\u00a0[there aren't any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HToXo6gS7-s)\n\n-   It ultimately comes down to\u00a0goals\u00a0and therefore what you're going to emphasize/work towards.\n\n##Useful posts/resources\n\n-   [The Absolute Beginner's Guide to the Gym](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cg9c8d/the_absolute_beginners_guide_to_the_gym/)\n\n-   [To Bulk And Cut Or Not To Bulk And Cut](https://bretcontreras.com/to-bulk-and-cut-or-not/)\n\n-   [Here is a credible, no BS approach to getting abs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsph7_-pizw&feature=youtu.be&t=146)\n\n##People to follow\n\n-   [pheasyque](https://www.instagram.com/pheasyque/)\u00a0- excellent diagrams, tutorials, and generally great content on how to lift properly\n\n-   [Stefi Cohen](https://www.instagram.com/steficohen/)\u00a0- 22 world records, doctorate in physical therapy, gym owner, coach.

I generally aim to gain .5-.75 lbs per week and lose .75-1 lbs per week. If I\u2019m gaining or losing too much, I adjust my macros ~ 250 calories and measure again for three weeks and so on\n\nHow does creatine factor into this .5-.75 weight gain? I just started working out, started taking 3g of creatine every day, and slightly upped my calories. How much weight could the creatine (with water) add in itself? Should I take that into consideration and allow for more weight gain? Or still .5-.75?",

Been watching my nutrition, been doing progressive overload, everything good. \n\nHowever I feel like I started lifting weights because I\u2019m 31 and was at a job desk since my twenties. Wanted to be in good shape and to find a functional body again. \n\nHowever, the more I\u2019m lifting the more I feel stiff (been doing yoga and mobility routine for 2 months now) but still, this is not what I was really after. I really want to find a functional body again. Be able to lift somebody hurt and to carry him for 200m (I\u2019m a former soldier so I still live in that fantasy). Being strongman or Arnold is nice but if your body is dogshit in terms of usefulness then I feel like it\u2019s not for me. \n\nWhat should I do then? Should I try bodyweight workouts? Should I start calisthenics with some app like freeletics? If I keep my nutrition like that (high protein) will I lose muscle? \n\nThanks and have a great day",

It seems the cardinal rule when it comes to building muscle/losing weight is \"calories in, calories out\", which makes sense. I'm 5'11 170 lbs but have significant body fat. From photos I see online, I'd say probably \\~30%. I started lifting (compound movements) 1.5 months ago so I'm a total beginner, and don't expect to be muscular at this point. I have just added LISS cardio which I plan to work up to 6 days a week.\n\nI don't have an \"issue\" with my weight. 170 seems about the perfect weight for me and my height. I've been counting calories and get  \\~1g per lb of my weight every day. But should I be more concerned about the fat intake?\n\nI lost 70 lbs. recently, solely focused on carbs. But now I don't really need to lose weight, I need to lose fat. From what I've read, people on cuts/bulks don't seem to worry too much about the fat intake as long as there is a deficit/surplus and you get sufficient protein. I'm not eating crap but I'm wondering if I should really hone in on low-fat foods as well? It's kinda tough to get enough protein and also keep it low fat. Thanks for any tips!",

You also need fat to stay healthy \nI eat nuts which contains healthy fats and allow to get a high calorie.

I have 2 eggs and sausage with avocado for breakfast, but I know the sausage is high fat. I should probably focus in on more lean meats and nuts.   \nAnd #4- yes I'm following basically a greyskull program. I do have targets in mind and keep track of my progress. I've been improving which is good. Though honestly the targets are a bit secondary. The way I see it, the strength will come in time- it will take many months and years to build that up. In the meantime, I just want to lean out and have some muscle to show, however \"weak\" I am comparatively. I don't expect to build too much strength right now as I am keeping myself on a calorie deficit (while still getting enough protein). I'm keeping the same lifting program 3x a week of compound lifts. I am focusing on progressive overload, but right now I plan to cut to maybe 160 and at least have a baseline of lean muscle to build from. I had been bulking but then I learned that if you are already high bodyfat, then the body tends to keep even more fat. So I'm trimming down again. I got down to 155 a couple of months ago so 160 is doable.",

You can, however, to an extent build muscle in certain spots - and in that light, I'd start with a shitload of upper body volume. Big, compound movements. Bench, incline bench, chinups, rows, 3-4 sets of each, 2-3 times per week. Go heavy, go hard.\n\nAlso, your test levels will make or break those gains.",

You can't spot reduce fat but building you upper body and abs/core will make you look more rectangular and to a certain point muscles will make you thinner/more toned. I'd avoid doing too much leg strength also, you can't spot reduce fat but you can build muscles. To see if your thighs are big mostly because of fat or muscle, try to flex your muscle as much as possible, pinch your thigh and feel how much of it is fat. If it's mostly muscle you might want to not do leg focused workouts. For a more boxy stomach, look into working the obliques as well as general core work. Also how tall are you? Because if you're short that might affect things as well (am a shortie so know the feeling).",

Currently I have a flat tummy, not much fat to burn there now.\n\nMy legs are pretty good need not that much work, I run, walk and hike a lot.

When it comes to cardio it's better to do them at least multiple hours after you strength training session, not right after or before.\nRunning 2x a week is a good start so I'd say you can spend Friday on a brisk long jogg  (don't if you feel sore).\n1. Start with 2 Running sessions one with a shorter but intense intervals and one with an easy jogg long distance jogg.\n\n2. Don't run on your legg day to avoid injury and impacting your strength. \n\n3. You can run on upper body day. Hours after your session or before.\n\n4. If you have enough time you can do upper body + abs all in one day. This will leave 2 or one day empty and so you can turn that or those empty days into running days. On what was supposed to be abs day.\n\n5. Stat with 2 and after 1 month increase run sessions to 3 per week and after that increase it to 4 after maybe 2-3 month of 3x. This will give you body ample time to adapt thus reducing chances of injury or overuse.\n\nSorry for the horrible grammar, I feel super lazy today.

I went on a vacation that had a lot of walking (a major achievement in of itself) and decided to build on that success.\n\nI started small, just 15 minutes a day on either my elliptical or rowing machine. My goal was to make it routine, and reduce my heart attack risk. I've been able to increase the intensity, slowly. Just doing what feels right. \n\nI've lost 3 inches off my waist line without loosing weight. My pants are starting fall off me. I'm looking trimmer than I have in years. The edema that is common with POTS is going away. \n\nNever in a million years would I have expected results like this in less than 3 months. It's clear the exercise is having huge impacts on fluid retention. \n\nI think increasing my core strength is helping the most, but frankly, I don't know what to do next.  I still can't do a sit up.

I started working out again at the beginning of this year and have been holding my routine strong for over 7 months now and haven\u2019t felt this good in years (since the last time I was regularly exercising). However, I\u2019ve been monitoring my heart rate closely recently, and I had some questions about if I may be overdoing my exercises.\n\nI exercise everyday of the week and have a target calories burned of 300 per day from exercising regardless of the exercises done. I lift weights 2 days a week and the rest of the week is cardio-type stuff (mostly on the elliptical). My target heart rate from very basic calculations you can find online should be a max of about 185 bpm. During weightlifting I get around 135 bpm average, which sounds about right. But when I\u2019m doing any kind of more intense cardio (I go for about 35 mins) my heart rate is usually in the 165-175 bpm range, which seems high based on what I\u2019ve read. I finish all my exercises feeling great (no gasping for breath or uncomfortable feelings from rapid heart beat) so I didn\u2019t think anything of it until recently.\n\nSo my questions are: am I overdoing it? Is there something else I should be doing? Are the online calculator tools actually accurate or does it vary widely from person to person?\n\nAny advice or insight is greatly appreciated!",

That isn't the same thing as strength or muscle growth, however. When you swap exercises, you are also losing some efficiency as you neural network/CNS learn new adapatations. Its minor unless you are swapping every week, but there is some impact there. Consistency also allows better progression monitoring. \n\nIn general, joint fatigue or boredome are the only reasons I change exercises. Some people get bored easier and need more frequent change. I also change based on equipment availability, but I have a few go-tos for specific muscle groups. \n\nI'd always recommend minor exercise changes to program changes.",

I don\u2019t include them in the shoulder workouts but instead as a finisher. What I\u2019m planning is doing lateral raises as a finisher after every workout (I do workouts 5 times a week so I would do lateral raises 5 times a week), and I would just increase it by 5 reps a week. Is this a good idea and would this train my shoulders? I always train to my maximum for it, and I always feel my shoulders, so I know it has some sort of impact.

So if I can say anything I\u2019d say to add weight lifting into your workouts. Lifting saved me. It burns more calories than running too. I seriously started melting off fat. \nObviously everyone is different but yano you should try it out with her and see if she falls in love w it like I did. Also don\u2019t forget that she probably wants to take her health seriously but is embarrassed. It sucks being that big when you know you shouldn\u2019t be and you have all those puberty emotions going through you and you hurt and you just get used to it.

        "content": "Hey everyone, I had a quick question. I started taking my weight loss seriously last year in November. I have gone from 315 lbs to 255 lbs but have been hard stuck on a plateau, bouncing from 254-258 for a little over a month. \n\nDuring the first three months of my journey I had a goal of 8k steps a day with weight training three days a week. Eventually I vunoed that up to four days a week but it was a very light and easy program with very little progressive load while I focused primarily on form. \n\nI got divorced at the beginning of this summer and ended up dropping weight training due to depression hitting me hard but I continued to walk and upped my goal to 10k steps a day. \n\nAbout a month ago I started to reincorporate strength training into my routine. I am doing it four days a week and have seen fantastic gains. I have seen a (Roughly) 5-10% load increase for *most* exercises from week to week (Sometimes even from day to day). I also started taking Creatine a week or two ago. I also upped my step goal from 10k to 15k per day. \n\nI am 35, male, 6'1\" tall and have basically never consistently exercised till this year (Though I have worked fairly physical jobs most of my life). I aim for a 2,000 net calories a day and usually eat somewhere between 2,750-3,000 gross calories a day. I track calories and exercise using a food scale, MyFitnessPal, and Samsung Fitness (Which is connected to my watch to track steps and calorie expenditure). \n\nSo my question is this: Do I need to reduce my calorie intake to get over this hump or am I seeing this struggle because my body is putting on muscle and this plateau will level out once I get past the \"Beginner gains\" stage of lifting? I was down to 249 lbs before a trip to New York where I wasn't as strict with tracking my calories and jumped to 255 and then I started weight training once I got back. ",

You can only control your own performance. \n\nIn absolute terms, I would say you are at novice/beginner level. You're not \"Untrained\" because I assume you have basic proficiency in the lift to be able to lift considerably more than your own bodyweight. \n\nDepends on the cohort you're comparing against in terms of what's \"normal\" or \"average\". Most people, even regular gym goers, would consider a 400lbs Deadlift very strong, but even at a local level in strongman that would be your entry level weight for a first timers comp - for max reps (say x5-10).\n\nAt your bodyweight I'd be shooting for around the early 300s for intermediate, around 400lbs for an advanced lifter, and if you hit 500lbs and above that would be very impressive. 600lbs you're at the elite level.\n\nEven so, you still get freaks. There is a woman in the UK called Rhiannon Lovelace who competes in the 61kg class (i think), so considerably lighter than 150, and hit over 600lbs which blows most distribution curves out of the water even for elite male lifters.\n\nEssentially- who gives a shit.

All of this time I've always worked out alone.\n\nI've been a really unathletic guy basically my whole life, and I'm still in pretty bad shape and usually the weakest guy at the gym (yeah I compare myself to others too much but that's besides the point lol) Though I look up a lot of fitness advice online, and I'd say that by now I mostly know what I'm doing, I still think it would be nice to get personal feedback from a trainer in real time, just to be sure. Also to maybe get me a better routine, since that's what I'm the most unsure about.\n\nI already feel pretty comfortable going to the gym regularly, and as I said online advice has helped me a ton and I think I mostly understand what I'm doing now, so I figured it would be enough to train with a trainer for a short while, maybe a few weeks or up to a few months?\n\nDo you guys think this would be worth it?

If you feel in the orientation or meet up that you are not being listened to, don't sign up. \n\nSome trainers have super high sales tactics. Trying to force you to sign up for 3 months, 6 months or a year. If they are unwilling to do just a month, odds are it is not a good fit for you.",

I\u2019ve use trainers on three other occasions (all for 60 day challenges) and each time with amazing results. The key for me is this, I\u2019m paying this person for their expertise so I\u2019m going to listen to them and do everything they tell me to do, what workouts, what intensity, how long, and what to eat. I haven\u2019t used a trainer for a few years now and it\u2019s definitely taken me longer to lose weight and build muscle on my own because I\u2019m not paying for it.

So you should focus on your fitness and try to be the best basketball player you physically can be. Your body will adapt much faster as a teenager than it will in your 20s-30s-40s and so on. Do drills, sprints, and some strength training. Try to eat as low-processed whole foods as you can, but don't forget the occasional fun treat and snacks. You will lean out because of the physical demands are so high. By the time  you reach your 20s, you'll be way ahead of the game in terms of physical fitness than 99.99% of your peers.  That will benefit you even if you decide that basketball is not the sport for you.  It sticks with you for the rest of your life.\n\n  \nTo put it another way, you can't lose weight \"right now\".  It takes several weeks and even months depending on your starting point. It would be a waste of time to focus on weight loss when that time could be better utilized being a better athlete. \n\nI'm 36, and this is the advice I'd give to my 13 year old self.",

But remember, feeling good starts from within.\n\nYou might feel a lot of pressure to look or act a certain way, but trust me\u2014you are good enough just as you are!\n\nIt's awesome that you're interested in fitness. Keep moving, play sports you enjoy, and hang out with friends. Eating healthy is important, but it's also okay to have snacks and sweets sometimes.\n\nMost people have felt the way you do now. When people say you're growing, it means your body and mind are still developing, so you need good food to stay healthy. Skipping meals or trying to lose weight by not eating isn't good for you.\n\nIf you're actually overweight and find it hard to move, try to eat less sugary stuff, choose healthier foods, and be more active. As you exercise and play sports, you\u2019ll gain muscle, which might make the scale go up, but you\u2019ll also lose fat. So don\u2019t worry too much about the number on the scale.\n\nYou can't choose where your body loses fat, and most diet pills don\u2019t work. The best thing you can do is eat healthy and exercise.\n\nYour body is really smart. If you're hungry, it\u2019s a sign you need food. If you're not hungry, you probably don't need to eat.\n\nSo, keep playing sports, eating well, and doing things you love. Give yourself time\u2014things will get better.",
